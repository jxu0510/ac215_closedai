Most of the global population live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), which have historically
received a small fraction of global resources for mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly in many
of these countries. This Review examines the mental health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs in
four parts. First, we review the emerging literature on the impact of the pandemic on mental health, which shows
high rates of psychological distress and early warning signs of an increase in mental health disorders. Second, we
assess the responses in different countries, noting the swift and diverse responses to address mental health in some
countries, particularly through the development of national COVID-19 response plans for mental health services,
implementation of WHO guidance, and deployment of digital platforms, signifying a welcome recognition of the
salience of mental health. Third, we consider the opportunity that the pandemic presents to reimagine global mental
health, especially through shifting the balance of power from high-income countries to LMICs and from narrow
biomedical approaches to community-oriented psychosocial perspectives, in setting priorities for interventions and
research. Finally, we present a vision for the concept of building back better the mental health systems in LMICs with
a focus on key strategies; notably, fully integrating mental health in plans for universal health coverage, enhancing
access to psychosocial interventions through task sharing, leveraging digital technologies for various mental health
tasks, eliminating coercion in mental health care, and addressing the needs of neglected populations, such as children
and people with substance use disorders. Our recommendations are relevant for the mental health of populations
and functioning of health systems in not only LMICs but also high-income countries impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic, with wide disparities in quality of and access to mental health care.

Introduction
Although much has been written about the mental
health implications of COVID-19,1,2 greater attention has
been given to high-income countries (HICs) than to
low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs),
where 83% of the global population live. LMICs have
historically received a small fraction of global health
resources for mental health.3 Furthermore, COVID-19 is
now spreading rapidly in many of these settings. The
relationship between mental health and COVID-19
among the vast population of LMICs is the focus of this
Review.
Major risk factors for mortality from COVID-19, such as
medical comorbidities including diabetes or heart
disease,4 are increasingly common in LMICs, especially
among individuals with lower educational levels.5,6
Despite the lower average age of populations in LMICs
compared with that in HICs offering some potential
protection, the high prevalence of comorbidities, along
with generally low levels of access to universal health
coverage,7 paint a worrying picture in terms of the
potential for lives to be lost to the pandemic. Leaving
aside the direct health effects of COVID-19, the knock-on
effects of efforts to contain the pandemic, such as
lockdowns, closure of schools, shifting allocation of
health resources, and curtailed livelihood opportunities,
have the potential to be devastating and long-lasting.

These measures are particularly detrimental for poor and
vulnerable people in countries with weak social safety
nets and inadequate economic resources to buffer against
lost livelihoods. Global economic growth is expected to
contract by 5–8% during and following the pandemic,
pushing up to 100 million people into extreme poverty.8
The expected vulnerability of LMICs to the negative
mental health sequelae of COVID-19 can be compared
with the impressive efforts in many of these resourcelimited countries to develop nationwide policies to address
the pandemic itself and its mental health consequences.
Some LMICs have developed model programmes to
address the pre-existing mental health-care needs and
increasing distress related to the pandemic, and have
implemented guidance on psychosocial programmes
from WHO and international organisations. The sen­
sitivity and comprehensiveness of these mental health
responses in some LMICs can be a model for other
countries, which are suffering from fragmented mental
health responses, minimal financial investment, and
scarce outreach to the most vulnerable populations.9
In this Review, we examine the global mental health
implications of the COVID-19 pandemic in four parts:
first, the impact of the pandemic on mental health;
second, the responses in different countries; third, the
opportunity that the pandemic presents to reimagine
global mental health; and finally, a future vision for

mental health systems. Although our concerns begin
with a focus on LMICs, the pandemic has shown the
profoundly interconnected nature of global health and
the opportunities for experiences and knowledge to
inform the mental health response in all countries.
As the COVID-19 pandemic is still unfolding at the
time of writing, and much of the research on mental
health concerns is ongoing, this Review seeks to provide
a narrative overview of some prominent findings to date.
We also attempt to look into the future to anticipate the
potential longer-term mental health effects that will
emerge in the aftermath of the health, economic, and
social consequences of the pandemic.

The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on
mental health
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the already large
treatment gap in mental health across LMICs, and
threatens to widen it. New demands for mental health
care in these countries intersect with fragile health
systems, scarce resources and workforce capacity, social
unrest and violence in response to COVID-19 contain­
ment strategies, and overall scarce and inequitable access
to evidence-based interventions.10–12 It can be speculated
that the long-term consequences on mental health will
be particularly severe in the lowest resourced and most
impoverished regions of the globe, where there was
virtually no access to mental health services before the
pandemic.13

Immediate impacts
Emerging reports on the impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic on mental health have primarily documented
the increase in symptoms of mental health distress,
which might reflect a normative response to the
extraordinary uncertainties and difficulties experienced
by populations. For example, reports have documented
increased prevalence of psychological distress among
health-care staff,14,15 associated with stigma and fear of
the disease.16 That said, these reports could also imply a
shifting of the population distribution of distress and a
consequent increase in the prevalence of clinically
significant mental health problems. This theory is
congruent with the few studies on the prevalence of
mental health disorders that we have identified.
For example, a nationwide online study of more
than 10 000 individuals in Bangladesh reported a
33% prevalence of depression and 5% prevalence of
suicidal ideation.17 Thus, recognising acute stress
responses is essential for preventive interventions to
reduce the incidence of clinically significant conditions
and to build systems that address the rising needs for
mental health care.
In LMICs worldwide, population-wide distress can be
attributed to continued uncertainties about the spread of
the disease, the effectiveness of containment strategies,
and when and how everyday life will return to some

resemblance of familiarity.18 These experiences of distress
are exacerbated by actions aimed at mitigating the spread
of COVID-19, in which governments in many LMICs
have implemented strict measures (eg, use of lockdowns).
These measures and related policy decisions have had
unprecedented effects on the economic and social sectors
in countries where the vast majority of people are
employed in the informal labour market and where
threats to their livelihood are already leading to public
resistance and, sometimes, violence.13,19 For instance, use
of force by law enforcement and the authorities has been
reported in several countries.20–23 There have been reports
of violence, arrests, and the abduction of journalists
and activists documenting questionable government
policies, corruption, and mismanagement in response to
COVID-19.20,24,25 The pandemic is also exposing the fact
that particular vulnerable groups, such as prisoners,
patients in psychiatric hospitals or social care homes,
people with disabilities, or women experiencing domestic
violence or abuse, might be at even greater risk of
psychological distress because pre-existing failures in
human rights protection are worsened,21,26 further
complicating other mental health consequences related
to COVID-19.14,15
Threats of the pandemic towards mental health can be
observed by systemic social inequities across demo­
graphic (eg, age, ethnicity, caste, religion, gender),
economic (eg, income, assets, unemployment), neigh­
bourhood (eg, housing structure or overcrowding), and
sociocultural (eg, social support, social capital, edu­
cation) characteristics.19,27,28 In high-income settings, low
educational levels and indices of economic and social
disadvantage, such as poor or overcrowded housing and
homelessness, unemployment, social isolation, and
loneliness, are important risk factors for contracting
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2).29,30 As poverty and socio­economic ineq­
uities are prominent in LMICs, and with poor coverage
of adequately resourced health-care and social safety
nets, it is plausible to expect mental health problems in
large sections of communities across LMICs. For
example, this pattern is already apparent in Brazil where
the greatest risk of disease transmission is among the
poorest communities in the country.31
Older populations are among the most affected by the
COVID-19 pandemic in terms of illness severity and
mortality. They are also more likely to suffer psychological
impacts due to isolation, which is complicated by
pre-existing physical health problems and medical
comorbidities, and reduced access to care.32,33 Additionally,
lockdowns and the diversion of all health-care services to
COVID-19 control and care affects people living with
serious mental illnesses, for whom access to mental
health care has been hindered during the pandemic.34
Therefore, COVID-19 is likely to lead to the recurrence or
worsening of disorders among this group, who are also
more likely to have other risk factors.

Another particularly vulnerable group are front-line
health workers who have been deployed and redeployed
for various tasks to try to contain the pandemic.35,36 Risk
factors include settings where many health workers have
inadequate personal protective equipment, experiencing
stigma and discrimination because of their profession,
personal fears of infecting their families and loved ones,
isolation from family members, and being quarantined.37,38
Mental health effects of the pandemic among health
workers have also manifested as experiences of trauma
and confusion, especially in the context of lack of clarity
on how to effectively treat patients with COVID-19.39–41

Long-term impacts
Without massive global action, the COVID-19 pandemic
is expected to have worldwide negative impacts on
economic and other social determinants of health in
the long term. Mental health conditions most
susceptible to negative social determinants include
anxiety, mood, and disorders related to trauma and
stress, which are already leading contributors to
disability worldwide, according to the Global Burden of
Disease study.42 The pandemic is laying the foundations
for a potential worldwide suicide increase as a result of
increased exposure to known risk factors, such as
economic stress, job insecurity and unemployment,
social isolation, decreased access to community
support, barriers to mental health treatment, and
exacerbated physical health problems, especially among
older adults.33,39,43 A model combining data from
multiple countries, including both HICs and LMICs,
suggests that job losses due to COVID-19 might result
in up to 9570 additional suicides per year worldwide.43
Time-trend regression models following the pandemic
in the USA showed a forecast of 3235 excess suicides
over 2 years attributable to the economic downturn
(3·3% increase per year) if the unemployment increase
is moderated, and an 8164 excess suicides over 2 years
(8·4% increase per year) if the increase is extreme.44
No such models currently exist for LMICs. However,
given that LMICs bear the bulk of the global burden of
suicide45 and are especially vulnerable to economic
devastation from the pandemic, it can be speculated that
suicide rates could increase markedly in these countries.
This theory is supported by a review of Indian media on
COVID-19 and suicide.46 One concern is that in many
LMICs, suicides often go under-reported or are reported
as different causes of death due to the associated stigma,
as well as other cultural or religious considerations.47,48
Therefore, it will be essential to ensure transparent and
rigorous reporting and monitoring of suicides in the
months and years ahead, not only to fully ascertain the
impacts of the pandemic but also to identify whether
there are regional differences in suicide rates and to
develop responses to mitigate these risk factors. Similarly,
substance use disorders represent another major cause
of mortality associated with previous global recessions,
www.thelancet.com/psychiatry Vol 8 June 2021

leading to a rise in so-called deaths of despair in affected
communities.49
Prolonged school closures are likely to have a profound
effect on the mental health of children, adolescents, and
young adults globally.50 Aside from the important
academic benefits of schooling, schools have an essential
role in shaping the mental wellbeing of young people by
providing a structured and supervised space for
socioemotional development, friendship and social
support networks, protection from risk-taking behav­
iours and exploitative labour, delays to early marriage
and childbearing, and gatekeeper services to detect and
intervene early to reduce child abuse. Furthermore,
schools often represent a key access point for food for
children in many LMICs.51 School meal and feeding
programmes are essential for ensuring sufficient
nutrition while promoting academic performance and
cognitive development.52,53 Therefore, the school closures
in response to the pandemic might have the unintended
consequence of increasing food insecurity among
children,54 which negatively affects mental health.

The response to mental health needs
To date, there is little evidence on the impact of mental
health programmes for multiple reasons: the COVID-19
pandemic is still progressing in many countries, most
programmes are being implemented under real-world
public health emergency circumstances with no
resources for evaluation, and there has been insufficient
time since the onset of the pandemic to complete and
publish comprehensive evaluations. Thus, the purpose
of this section is to highlight the variety and inno­
vativeness of programmes that have been initiated. The
initiative and ability of governments in LMICs to develop
COVID-19 mental health plans is in itself an important
observation. Similarly, the ability to launch and
implement diverse programmes addressing populationlevel and individual clinical needs offers lessons about
implementation, even if claims about effectiveness
cannot yet be made for most of these initiatives. Going
forward, it will be important to evaluate implementation
processes and outcomes, not least to inform the mental
health response to future public health emergencies,
such as the extent to which the shift of care delivery from
in-person to remote addresses individual clinical needs
equitably or the extent to which low-cost positive
psychology approaches adequately address population
mental health needs.

Population initiatives
Since the start of the pandemic, there have been growing
efforts to develop international guidance, national
policies, and resources for LMICs to address mental
health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) needs
(figure 1).55–74 In February, 2020, the Inter-Agency Standing
Committee, which coordinates responses to humanitarian
emergencies, issued one of the first briefing notes with

MHPSS recommendations for COVID-19.55 The brief
highlighted approaches for specific populations, such as
older people, children, front-line workers, and individuals
in quarantine, as well as guidance on combating stigma.
Shortly after this event, the International Federation of
the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) called
for widespread use of psychological first aid, including
remote delivery to people in quarantine, health workers,
and groups with previous vulnerabilities (eg, mental and
substance use disorders).75 The International Organization
for Migration provided guidelines for forced and labour
migrants.59 The Africa Centres for Disease Control and
Prevention also released guidelines on MHPSS for
COVID-19.71 In May, 2020, the UN released a policy brief
that synthesised and added political weight to these
recommendations.70
Many of the guidelines in response to COVID-19 were
grounded in pre-COVID-19 approaches to MHPSS in
humanitarian settings, and the experience of imple­
menting MHPSS services in LMICs.76–78 Notable among
these are Inter-Agency Standing Committee MHPSS
guidelines published in 2007,64 which have been
continually revised and supplemented with additional
guidance. These guidelines are organised as a pyramid
of services with four layers: basic services and
secu­rity, strengthening community and family, focused
non-specialised supports, and specialised services.79

Furthermore, many LMICs have gained considerable
expertise in addressing MHPSS in response to
humanitarian emergencies,80,81 and there is emerging
consensus on the central principles for supporting
individuals in such contexts. Some of these principles
include the recommendations by Hobfoll and colleagues,82
which address five domains: safety, calm, self-efficacy and
community efficacy, connectedness, and hope.
Therefore, on the basis of previous humanitarian
emergencies and the unique needs of the COVID-19
pandemic, many LMICs rapidly developed COVID-19
national MHPSS response plans. The National Health
Commission of China developed guidelines on emer­
gency psychological crisis intervention, emphasising
that mental health services should be organised at city,
municipal, and provincial levels, and included psy­
chological outreach teams and hotlines.57 In March, 2020,
Lebanon issued a government action plan for a
MHPSS response, outlining mental health promotion
and mitigation of COVID-19 related stres­sors, support
for people in quarantine and front-line workers, and
continuity of services for patients with pre-existing
mental illness.61 Similar national action plans were
released in South Africa,62 Kenya,63 Uganda,64
the Maldives,65 and India.66 Some regional responses
within countries preceded national plans. For example,
the Kerala State Government in India constituted a
multidisciplinary team in February, 2020, which
integrated efforts by several sectors and established a
state helpline.83
Materials have been developed in many LMICs to
promote self-help for stress management during the
COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. WHO developed Doing
what matters in times of stress: an illustrated guide.67 The
stress management self-help techniques can be practised
with just a few minutes each day and include
accompanying audio exercises. Released originally in
English, with other translations underway, the guide is
freely available for use and adaptation, and can be offered
as guided or unguided self-help. In India, Firework, a
short-format, 30-second, decentralised video platform
that began in 2019, launched #sparkthejoy, a social
impact campaign that encourages people to do an “act of
good”.84 Use of the platform doubled during the period
between lockdowns in India from the beginning of
March to the end of May, 2020.85 The Mental Health
Innovation Network and WHO launched Stories from the
field: providing mental health and psychosocial support
during the COVID-19 pandemic69 to share MHPSS
innovation and best practice through personal narratives
from health-care workers worldwide. Information,
education, and communication materials highlighting
mental health and stigma have been produced by many
institutions and organisations implementing or sup­
porting responses in LMICs, such as the IFRC Reference
Centre for Psychosocial Support. In China, mental health
education materials were produced and disseminated

Detection and care
In many countries, members of the health-care system,
ranging from community health workers to mental
health specialists, have been trained to help detect
individuals with mental illness and psychological
distress (figure 2). Phone-based programmes in Kerala,
India, and in-person initiatives in Pakistan and Uganda
have been used to identify and refer people in need of
care.87,88 In China, individuals at risk of suicide can be
recognised by the artificial intelligence programme
Tree Holes Rescue by analysing the messaging service
Weibo.57 In Peru, Socios en Salud has disseminated
information via mass media to engage with a chatbot
that provides free automated depression screening and
referral.89
However, in most settings in LMICs, ongoing
in-person mental health services have been disrupted
and patients with severe mental illness and substance

use disorders are often unable to obtain medications,
attend treatment facilities, or receive social services.34
People with severe mental health conditions and
intellectual disabilities, along with various other
disabilities, are disproportionately likely to be in insti­
tutions, which are often not safe in relation to risk of
SARS-CoV-2 infection and where care has often been
compromised during the crisis.90 In some settings,
outpatient services have been suspended or inpatient
psychiatric facilities temporarily repurposed to treat
patients with COVID-19.91 Seeking psychiatric care,
especially from hospital facilities, has decreased because
of concerns about SARS-CoV-2 infection and stigma due
to associations of institutionalised settings with
COVID-19 transmission.92 In Iran, implementation of
drug use rehabilitation has been disrupted due to travel
restrictions, a shift towards COVID-19 priorities,93
and rejection of external support (eg, expelling
Médecins Sans Frontières94). In other settings, hospitals
and drug and alcohol services have been overwhelmed
with large influxes of patients facing substance
use withdrawal following lockdown, with many
countries suspending alcohol sales during lockdown

(eg, South Africa and India). There is a debate regarding
the ethics of forced abstinence.95
Face-to-face services have been maintained in parts of
some LMICs, indicating considerable variability in the
response of the mental health-care system.96 For example,
in Punjab, India, opioid drug replacement therapy was
successfully implemented.97 In Brazil, a hybrid model of
in-person and remote services was instituted for
individuals with psychotic disorders, including depot
antipsychotic injections delivered during in-home visits,
in which food insecurity was monitored.98 A similar
model of home visits for patients with severe mental
illness is ongoing in Uganda amid the pandemic.99
Furthermore, governments, health-care providers, and
other institutions in many LMICs have adapted to the
challenges imposed by physical distancing, disrupted
public transportation, and lockdowns by shifting to
remote services, ranging from suicide and mental health
helplines, to voice-only phone-based services, to video
services over smartphones or other digital devices. To
help promote public mental health during the COVID-19
pandemic, the Indonesian Government, through the
Ministry of Health, launched Sejiwa (ie, healthy mind) as
a counselling hotline service.100 From its launch date on
April 29 to May 28, 2020, Sejiwa provided 14 916 hotline
consultations with a workforce of 737 volunteer psy­
chologists from the Indonesian Psychology Association.
Similar helplines have experienced heavy use in India,101,102
Nigeria,103 the Philippines,104 and many other LMICs.
Helplines have also been used for specific populations,
such as south Asian labour migrants in Gulf countries
and other settings.58
In the Maldives and other countries, helplines have
provided psychological first aid to front-line workers.58 In
South Africa, videos were developed for health-care
workers highlighting symptoms of stress, anxiety, and
depression, with links to seek assistance. These videos
were distributed via social media. Non­
-governmental
psychology and counselling groups in the country also
offered free counselling via phone or Zoom to healthcare workers during the height of the outbreak.105 In
China, WeChat-based resources have been widely
established throughout the country to provide free,
24 h services, including cognitive behavioural therapy.57
In the Philippines, health-care workers and repatriated
overseas Filipino workers can book appointments for
online or phone-based MHPSS services.104 These services
predominantly address general psychological distress
and common mental disorders, such as depression and
anxiety, as well as suicidality.
A major initiative has been building capacities among
non-specialists to deliver psychological services remotely.
Problem Management Plus, a five-session psychological
intervention based on problem solving therapy and
designed for delivery by non-specialists in humanitarian
settings,106 has been adapted for remote training and
delivery (eg, voice-only phone or with video) by the IFRC

in east African countries,107 Socios en Salud in Peru, and
other organisations. In Peru, individuals identified to
have depression with the chatbot89 are referred for remote
Problem Management Plus. Another problem-solving
therapy, the Friendship Bench, which is delivered by
non-specialists in Zimbabwe, is now being adapted for
online delivery.108 Based on the large demand for
psychological services to be delivered remotely, WHO
has adapted the Ensuring Quality in Psychological
Support (EQUIP) platform.68 The result, EQUIP-remote,
includes guidance on preparing for remote delivery
(eg, confidentiality and technology issues), delivering
supervision for remote services, and managing suicidality
in remote delivery, as well as a competency assessment
tool to support safe delivery of psychological services.
These recommendations are an extension of WHO’s
overall guidance on assuring quality and comprehensive
care in the shift from in-person to remote delivery of
health services during the COVID-19 pandemic.73
However, access to these interventions is not equitably
distributed. Settings with restricted phone, electricity, or
WiFi access cannot engage in all of these services. People
with disabilities who, as well as being exposed to other
social determinants of mental ill health and exposure
to COVID-19, often encounter practical barriers to
accessing support, and many of the interventions
delivered are often not accessible to those with sensory
impairments.109 In relation to children and adolescents,
mental health care that would have otherwise been
delivered via school counsellors or student health
services has been disrupted as a result of school and
university closures.50 One innovation in Pakistan has
been the launch of nationwide, free, online training
sessions in parent-mediated therapy to support
rehabilitative care of children with disabilities by
Aga Khan University, Karachi.110

Infectious disease control efforts integrating mental
health principles
A valuable lesson learned from the Ebola virus outbreak
was that MHPSS services are important not only for
reducing mental health problems but also for effective
infectious disease control.111,112 Initial suspicion in some
communities that Ebola virus was a government
conspiracy led to the realisation in west Africa that
engagement with communities, families, and individuals
needed to focus on trust building, listening skills, and
managing distress.113 Therefore, in response to the
outbreak, community healing dialogues were an impor­
tant MHPSS initiative to build trust and engagement with
public health recommendations for infection control.114
This response showed that MHPSS training was vital for
contact tracers to build trust, support treatment
engagement, and recognise distress that would benefit
from mental health services.111 Thus, psychological first
aid training is now recommended for contact tracers
during infectious disease control.115 Currently, in Liberia,

Reimagining the principles of global mental
health
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many previous
certainties about the way that societies are organised, and
the relationship between governments and their citizens
and between nations; however, it also offers a window of
opportunity to rethink old assumptions and to re-evaluate
priorities in and approaches to global mental health. We
argue that global mental health can and must do better to
successfully respond to the mental health challenges posed
by COVID-19 globally. These efforts will involve hastening
the shift from the treatment gap notion, with its implicit
biomedical emphasis, to a broader care gap perspective,118
increased recognition of the crucial contribution of civil
society and local leadership, and action beyond the health
sector, to make the contexts in which people grow up, live,
work, and age more promoting of mental health. Although
the framework shift that we propose is not new,119 it has not
yet been achieved at scale. To accomplish this goal, we set
out key opportunities organised around three dimensions
for change: context (ie, where), stakeholders (ie, who), and
sectors (ie, what).

Panel 1: Examples of service user partnership in the
COVID-19 pandemic response
• The Global Mental Health Peer Network, an international
organisation for mental health service users, partnered with
Human Rights in Mental Health–Federation Global Initiative
on Psychiatry, an international organisation that promotes
user-oriented mental health services, has advocated for
greater equality and equity in the pandemic response
through a joint position statement.143
• In a study that examined the psychosocial consequences
of the pandemic, the Global Mental Health Peer Network
collaborated with the World Dignity Project to carry out a
global survey to ensure that the voices of people with
lived experience of mental health, their families,
and professionals who work with them are heard.144
• As a result of amplified needs for mental health support
due to the pandemic, several mental health service user
organisations have been involved in providing support.
For example, the Psychiatric Disability Organization Kenya
is providing psychosocial support for prison staff in
Nakuru working in isolation, the Zimbabwe Obsessive
Compulsive Disorder Trust is providing peer support
addressing anxiety due to COVID-19, and the Global
Mental Health Peer Network is running online COVID-19
and mental health virtual support groups twice monthly.

Context: the where of global mental health
The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that successful
public health responses are not necessarily correlated
with national gross domestic product. Some LMICs in
Asia and Africa have shown how the pandemic can be
managed with minimal loss of life, whereas some HICs
in Europe and North America have had some of the
highest mortality rates in the world.120 The pandemic
indicates that the time has come to abandon the HIC
versus LMIC dichotomy, which obscures meaningful
variations within and between contexts, and too often
carries an implicit assumption of unidirectional learning.
Moving beyond these categories by thinking in terms of
differently resourced settings, we can recognise the
diversity of resources including, but not limited to,
financial resources that distinguish between contexts
globally and can be harnessed to face crises and improve
health. For example, religious centres, community ties,
family support structures, traditional healers, village
leaders, and youth groups are all contextually varying
resources that are essential to engage with to overcome
mental and physical health threats, including those of
COVID-19.121–123 Compared with deficit-based assessments
of resources, typically defined in terms of money and
biomedical resources, strength-based assessments
provide more nuanced perspectives on the assets of
heterogeneous contexts and avoid the displacement of
effective local strategies by imported, context-free
approaches.121 Much can be learned from implementation
542

research methodologies that measure local conditions
and evaluate context-dependent mechanisms of change
when evaluating interventions and implementation
strategies for mental health care across settings.125
A new architecture of global mental health is emerging,
which challenges the view that LMICs are simply data
collection sites126,127 or test beds for interventions
developed in HICs, and promotes equitable, mutually
beneficial partnerships with HICs.99 Insights from
LMICs will be vital for promoting mental health during
the COVID-19 pandemic. During the short history of
global mental health, there has already been an
investment in building capacity in LMICs for research in
the field.128–130 Additionally, there has been a substantial
increase in research led by LMICs, and this is now
influencing the way in which mental health care is
envisaged in HICs.127 However, research priorities and
programmes in global mental health are still too often
led by funders and academics from HICs.131,132 Research
from LMICs is valued less in terms of strength of
evidence and potential global impact, even when
objectively rated as having equivalent quality.133
Addressing this bias requires HIC researchers, funders,
and journal editors to embrace a position of humility,
alongside challenging enduring colonial attitudes built
into the education of LMIC professionals.134 In the face of
the COVID-19 pandemic, the new norm must be mutual
learning between all countries because even HICs are a
long way from reaching universal and equitable coverage
of mental health care.

Stakeholders: the who of global mental health
For both infectious disease and mental health, public
health strategies fail when communities are not engaged
with or are treated as passive recipients.135 Communities,
including families of people with mental health con­
ditions, local leadership, community health workers, and
traditional and religious healers, must be empowered as
active partners in delivering public health initiatives that
are grounded in local realities and that recognise the
interdependence of mental health, physical health, and
social and economic context. Protecting mental health in
the face of COVID-19 will be contingent on strategic
coalitions and the development of collective pressure
groups.
There have been some positive steps towards increased
collaboration in global mental health, including evidence
of effective collaboration between primary care workers
and traditional and faith healers.136 However, global
mental health advocates should become much firmer
in demanding participatory action to implement
community-led responses to the mental health impact of
COVID-19, by taking advantage of a global climate where
power structures are challenged, linking in with
collective movements such as MeToo, Black Lives Matter,
and student-led movements against environmental
degra­dation.137 Young people’s voices must be central to

this endeavour, particularly given the potential longterm impact of the pandemic on their life chances.
Similarly, the role of people with lived experience of
mental ill health, their families and caregivers, and other
groups at risk in shaping the systems that exist to serve
their needs must go beyond nominal participation,
recognising their unique perspective as experts by
experience.138 Setting policy without meaningful
engagement of individuals with lived experience as key
stakeholders risks, at best, wasting resources on
ineffective strategies and, at worst, causing harm.139,140
People with lived experience have a key role in leading
social contact anti-stigma inter­ventions,141,142 which is of
particular relevance to efforts addressing intersecting
the stigma related to COVID-19 and mental health. As
the COVID-19 pandemic strains trust in authorities,
localism becomes more important than ever as an
effective approach to scaling up inter­ventions.
The potential of peer support and further collaboration
with people with lived experience of mental illness needs
to be recognised within mental health-care systems,
building on emerging initiatives (panel 1). Key lessons
are to invest in capacity building for service users and to
support peer workers to bring relational values to work
(ie, offering equal, reciprocal relationships and taking a
whole-of-life approach rather than one focused on
illness). Currently, both LMICs and HICs have a long
way to go in ensuring involvement of service users in
research, policy, and programme implementation and
evaluation.145,146 For system change, there needs to be a
conscious effort, backed by investment and policy, to
equip and enable service users to be actively involved in
all aspects of the system of care.147

Sectors: the what of global mental health
To achieve good mental health as part of COVID-19
response efforts, we must ensure that people’s basic needs
are met and that human rights are protected. When social
inequalities remain unaddressed, mental health inter­
ventions are less effective.148,149 The pandemic response,
including the mental health response, requires recognition
of the syndemic co-occurrence and inter­action of mental
health, physical health, and social context (panel 2). Many
of the social determinants of poor mental health, such as
living in cramped conditions, scarce access to clean water
and green spaces, poor nutrition, informal employment,
and precarious working conditions, increase the risk of
contracting SARS-CoV-2 and suffering complications after
infection.156 Therefore, economic recovery packages
should strategically address the social determinants that
increase susceptibility to both COVID-19 and mental ill
health. Across diverse settings, growing evidence indicates
that national-level policies to improve the living conditions
of low-paid workers and families can improve mental
health at the population level.157–159 Social welfare, active
labour market programmes that help people to retain or
regain jobs, family support programmes, and debt support

Panel 2: Applying syndemic theory to global mental health
in the context of COVID-19
Syndemic theory postulates that specific localised sociocultural,
economic, and political conditions contribute to patterns of
multimorbidity, and that settings without the same contextual
features will not share these multimorbidity patterns.150–152
Syndemic theory goes beyond comorbidity to recognise the
clustering of health burdens in a specific population that
biologically interact to worsen health, and the shared
sociostructural forces that exacerbate the biological disease
interaction.150,153 Therefore, diseases become concentrated in
specific geographical or temporal contexts where people are
exposed to harmful social conditions, interacting at individual
and population levels to worsen health.
The ways in which, in some settings, COVID-19 is comorbid
with high prevalence of non-communicable diseases,
including cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic, and mental
health conditions, and that these other conditions fall along
gradients of economic and other disparities, suggests that
there are different types of syndemics around the world,
including in low-income and middle-income countries. There
is not one universal COVID-19 syndemic, but rather contextspecific interactions substantially aggravated in specific social
groups and geographies.152 We cannot refer to a global
COVID-19 syndemic, as the stark differences in disease
pattern and response between countries like New Zealand
and the USA clearly show. A nuanced and localised approach
is crucial.
Approaching different local syndemics that involve COVID-19
highlights the need for integrated, intersectoral,
and interdisciplinary responses. The interactions between
substance misuse, violence, and HIV or AIDS154 led to the
development of various multilevel interventions, including
integrated behavioural interventions focusing on intimate
partner violence and HIV prevention; integrated traumafocused care to reduce substance misuse and post-traumatic
stress disorder; synchronous community mobilisation
interventions to reduce gender-based violence,
HIV, and sexually transmitted illnesses (among men and
women); and economic empowerment interventions to
reduce gender-based violence and HIV risk.155 For COVID-19,
taking a syndemic approach should similarly influence mental
health responses and research, by recognising how biological
and sociostructural factors interact to create mental health
inequalities and by promoting a multilevel, intersectoral
response that addresses the sociopolitical dynamics that lead
to the clustering and interaction of poverty, infection,
and mental ill health.150

are all likely to help reduce the mental health impact of
the crisis.160 In Latin America and Africa, governmental

umented positive

Panel 3: Recommendations to build back better
Integrating mental health services into UHC
Collaborative care strategies for building community capacity,
based in primary care setup for community care and linkages
with specialist services, is and must be the singular focus for
investment.178 Collaborative care designs are essential in UHC
and must be contextually appropriate and, through intersectoral
partnerships, simultaneously address social and human rights
concerns. It is essential to avoid impoverishment and
catastrophic health-care costs in accessing mental health care.
Improving access and coverage of psychosocial interventions
A crucial aspect of UHC for mental health care is the community
delivery of psychosocial interventions by front-line providers,
such as community health workers and peers (ie, task-sharing
interventions). These providers are needed for addressing mental
health issues related to COVID-19 and for deploying a host of
innovations, such as digital training and competency
assessment, peer supervision, and quantifiable quality metrics,
to help build a workforce to address prevention and treatment
gaps.179–182
Eliminating coercion in mental health care
The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has
laid down the foundational values of a world in which coercion
must be abolished in all aspects of health care and for all
people, and has developed various strategies to support
decision making, rather than substitute it.183 A crucial element is
engagement of people with lived experience. Peer support
activities are associated with improved treatment outcomes
and promotion of human rights.184,185 These strategies are
essential during the COVID-19 pandemic for the inclusion of
individuals with mental health conditions in the design and
implementation of services.186,187

gender, education, employment, and social networks is
attracting fresh policy attention in the face of unprecedented
worsening of poverty and inequality in the near future.
Intersectoral strategies are essential for sustainable recovery
from mental disorders, and for addressing stigma and other
negative consequences associated with health seeking119 for
overall reduction in the incidence of new cases.
Addressing the mental health of children and young people
One blind spot of global mental health has been its relative
neglect of children and young people (aged <24 years).
More than 80% of the world’s young people live in low-income
and middle-income countries. Given how the complete closure
of schools and colleges is directly affecting the lives of
young people, building back better with intersectional
approaches must explicitly address this crucially important
demographic group to promote nurturing environments at
home, in schools, and across neighbourhoods.189
Incorporating technological innovations in mental health
services
The COVID-19 pandemic has fuelled a striking transformation
in the use of digital platforms for various mental health-care
tasks. The opportunities presented by use of digital technology
could address stigma and discrimination, isolation and
marginalisation; identify individuals at risk (through social
media footprints); and assist with the training and supervision
of front-line workers. However, caution is needed so that its use
does not increase the existing disparities in access. Use of
personal digital information also needs to be done in
accordance with local regulations and in a way that maximises
protection of privacy and confidentiality.190
UHC=universal health coverage.

Integrating mental health interventions into other sectors
COVID-19 has amply shown the interdependence of health and
other sectors.188 The relationships between mental health and

COVID-19.161 For example, greater coverage of the
conditional cash transfer programme, Bolsa Família, in
municipalities across Brazil was associated with reduced
suicide rates.162 In Malawi’s Social Cash Transfer
Programme, depressive symptoms in young people were
reduced by 15 percentage points, with the greatest benefits
for those with the worst mental health.163,164 Examples of
other initiatives that have incorporated social and
economic interventions into health programmes with
important lessons for the crisis include the Atmiyata
programme165 and the Society for Nutrition, Education,
and Health Action’s violence prevention interventions166 in
India, Dream-a-World cultural therapy in Jamaica,167 the
integrated intervention model for dialogue and screening
in Kenya,168 and innovative nutrition programmes that
simultaneously address violence, poverty, and mental
distress in Ecuador.169

Furthermore, inequality is an important determinant
of mental health,170 and this is worsening as a result of
the pandemic. Therefore, we must follow the Sustainable
Development Goal principle of leaving no one behind
and target interventions for the most marginalised
groups. Such groups include people with severe mental
illness or disabilities, communities living in extreme
poverty, immigrants and displaced populations, and
individuals who face discrimination for any reason.171,172
The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic further justify
use of the principle of proportionate universalism,160
which focuses on protecting the rights and basic needs of
young people (eg, enabling schools to open safely);
reducing gender-based violence, which has escalated
during the pandemic; and implementing environmental
protection strategies, given the impact of environmental
degradation on virus transmission and mental health.173

Building back better
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected mental health in
all contexts and has highlighted the weaknesses of
mental health systems globally. COVID-19 has shown the
mental health impacts of pandemics not only on
individuals with existing mental health needs but also
across populations due to the polices aimed to stem its
spread, which disproportionately affect vulnerable and
already disadvantaged groups. It is vital that we recognise
these effects as a historic opportunity to reimagine
mental health systems, building on the vast body of
clinical, implementation, and public health science119,174
with the active engagement of all relevant stakeholders,
particularly people with lived experience.
Building back better was a concept introduced in a
report issued at the second anniversary of the
2004 Indian Ocean tsunami by the UN SecretaryGeneral’s Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery, former
US president, Bill Clinton.175 Since then, the concept
has become the approach for nearly all post-disaster
reconstruction programmes, including upending
previously unchal­lenged and inadequate policies and
practices. In 2013, the principles of building back better
were used by WHO to provide a framework to support
the development of sustainable post-disaster mental
health systems, globally.176 Resource-limited countries,
such as Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Jordan, Nepal, and the
occupied Palestinian territories, have shown how
fragile mental health systems can be strengthened
during and in the wake of public health emergencies.
The COVID-19 pandemic and the likelihood of future
pandemics highlight the importance of resilient and
responsive mental health systems.177 Although increased
global and national investments in mental health were in
great need even before the COVID-19 pandemic, there is
a threat that the diversion of policy focus on the pandemic
might further delay progress in mental health. We must
work in concert with all stakeholders to ensure that
resources are mobilised for strengthening mental health
systems and that these investments are used in an
effective and efficient manner, and cover the entire
spectrum of needs, from promotion, protection, and
prevention to treatment, care, and recovery. Reports from
The Lancet Commission on global mental health and
sustainable development119 and World Bank’s Disease
Control Priorities174 have outlined priorities for the
strengthening of mental health systems. Within the
context of COVID-19, we recommend a set of practical
actions to address these priorities (panel 3).

Conclusions
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted every aspect of
life in all countries almost simultaneously and, in this
respect, represents a global phenomenon unlike any
other in human history. Emerging evidence indicates
that the mental health impacts will be large, longlasting, and greatest in under-resourced contexts and

Search strategy and selection criteria
Section leads searched the peer-reviewed literature on
PubMed for articles published between Jan 1 and
July 31, 2020, describing the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on mental health using the search terms “mental
health”, “depression”, “anxiety”, “psychosis”,
“schizophrenia”, “posttraumatic stress disorder”, “suicide”,
“substance use disorders”, “alcohol use disorders”, or “child
and adolescent mental health” and “COVID-19”. The search
was restricted to articles published in English. We used the
current fiscal-year classifications of World Bank Country and
Lending Groups and included low-income, lower-middleincome, and upper-middle-income countries on the basis of
2019 economic data. Given that research on this topic
continues to evolve rapidly and, to date, there have been
relatively few studies published from low-income and
middle-income countries, we broadened our search to
Google searches and contacted key informants (including
the large and globally representative group of authors of
this Review). We reviewed reports and guidance from WHO,
the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, MHPSS.net and
mhinnovation.net, and reached out to non-governmental
organisations in low-income and middle-income countries.
The resulting literature was summarised and interrogated
by our authorship group, which included senior global
mental health experts, and relevant content was
synthesised through multiple rounds of feedback and
review.

disadvantaged populations. Unless addressed robustly
and urgently, these impacts will contribute to enormous
human suffering, premature mortality, and social
breakdown, and will slow down economic recovery.
Although there was already an enormous crisis relating
to mental health before the pandemic, COVID-19
presents an historic opportunity for all countries and
global agencies to reassess how human society organises
itself to recover from these impacts. We know what this
should look like; not only should we invest in building
mental health systems now but we should also ensure
that these investments embrace the diversity of
experiences and actions that characterise mental ill
health, well beyond the narrow biomedical focus on
doctors, diagnoses, and drugs that has dominated
mental health policies globally. Thus, we call for a
balanced approach that addresses the social determinants
of mental health and the individual clinical needs for
people with mental health disorders. Mental health
interventions that fail to take account of social
determinants of mental ill health, especially those
exacerbated by COVID-19, will fail to achieve their

aspiration in all countries worldwide.
