Cognitive–behavioral therapy for
management of mental health and stress-
related disorders: Recent advances in
techniques and technologies
Mutsuhiro Nakao1*, Kentaro Shirotsuki2 and Nagisa Sugaya3
Abstract
Cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) helps individuals to eliminate avoidant and safety-seeking behaviors that
prevent self-correction of faulty beliefs, thereby facilitating stress management to reduce stress-related disorders
and enhance mental health. The present review evaluated the effectiveness of CBT in stressful conditions among
clinical and general populations, and identified recent advances in CBT-related techniques. A search of the literature
for studies conducted during 1987–2021 identified 345 articles relating to biopsychosocial medicine; 154 (45%)
were review articles, including 14 systemic reviews, and 53 (15%) were clinical trials including 45 randomized
controlled trials. The results of several randomized controlled trials indicated that CBT was effective for a variety of
mental problems (e.g., anxiety disorder, attention deficit hypersensitivity disorder, bulimia nervosa, depression,
hypochondriasis), physical conditions (e.g., chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, breast
cancer), and behavioral problems (e.g., antisocial behaviors, drug abuse, gambling, overweight, smoking), at least in
the short term; more follow-up observations are needed to assess the long-term effects of CBT. Mental and physical
problems can likely be managed effectively with online CBT or self-help CBT using a mobile app, but these should
be applied with care, considering their cost-effectiveness and applicability to a given population.

History of cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT)
CBT is a type of psychotherapeutic treatment that helps
people to identify and change destructive or disturbing
thought patterns that have a negative influence on their
behavior and emotions [1]. Under stressful conditions,
some individuals tend to feel pessimistic and unable to
solve problems. CBT promotes more balanced thinking
to improve the ability to cope with stress. The origins of
CBT can be traced to the application of learning theory
principles, such as classical and operant conditioning, to
clinical problems. So-called “first-wave” behavioral ther-
apy was developed in the 1950s [2]. In the US, Albert El-
lis founded rational emotive therapy to help clients
modify their irrational thoughts when encountering
problematic events, and Aaron Beck employed cognitive
therapy for depressed clients using Ellison’s model [3].
Behavioral therapy and cognitive therapy were later inte-
grated in terms of theory and practice, leading to the
emergence of “second-wave” CBT in the 1960s. The
first- and second-wave forms of CBT arose via attempts
to develop well-specified and rigorous techniques based
on empirically validated basic principles [4]. From the
1960s onward, the dominant psychotherapies worldwide

have been second-wave forms of CBT. Recently, how-
ever, a third-wave form of CBT has attracted increasing
attention, leading to new treatment approaches such as
acceptance and commitment therapy, dialectical behav-
ior therapy, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, func-
tional analytic psychotherapy, and extended behavioral
activation; other forms may also exist, although this is
subject to conjecture [4]. In a field of psychosomatic
medicine, it has been reported that cognitive restructur-
ing is effective in improving psychosomatic symptoms
[5], exposure therapy is suitable for a variety of anxious
disease conditions like panic disorder and agoraphobia
[6], and mindfulness reduces stress-related pain in fibro-
myalgia [7]. Several online and personal computer-based
CBT programs have also been developed, with or with-
out the support of clinicians; these can also be accessed
by tablets or smartphones [8]. Against this background,
this review focused on the effectiveness of CBT with a
biopsychosocial approach, and proposed strategies to
promote CBT application to both patient and non-
patient populations.
Research on CBT
Using “CBT “and “biopsychosocial” as PubMed search
terms, 345 studies published between January 1987 and
May 2021 were identified (Fig. 1); 14 of 154 review arti-
cles were systemic reviews, and 45 of 53 clinical trials
were randomized controlled trials. Most clinical trials re-
cruited the samples from patient populations in order to
assess specific diseases, but some targeted at those from
non-patient populations like a working population in
order to assessing mind-body conditions relating to sick
leave [9]. The use of biopsychosocial approaches to treat
chronic pain is shown to be clinically and economically
efficacious [10]; for example, CBT is effective for chronic
low-back pain [11]. The prevalence of chronic low-back
pain, defined as pain lasting for more than 3 months,
was reported to be 9% in primary-care settings and 7–
29% in community settings [12]. Chronic low-back pain
is not only prevalent, but is a source of significant phys-
ical disability, role impairment, and diminished psycho-
logical well-being and quality of life [11]. Interestingly,
according to the results of our own study [13], CBT was
effective
among
hypochondriacal
patients
without
chronic low-back pain, but not in hypochondriacal pa-
tients with chronic low-back pain. These group differ-
ences did not seem to be due to differences in the
baseline levels of hypochondriasis. Although evidence
has suggested that both hypochondriasis and chronic
low-back pain can be treated effectively with CBT [10,
11, 14], this has not yet been validated. Chronic low-
back pain may be associated with a variety of conditions,
including anxiety, depression, and somatic disorders
such as illness conviction, disease phobia, and bodily
preoccupation. The core psychopathology of hypochon-
driacal chronic low-back pain should be clarified to pro-
mote adequate symptom management [13].
Since 2000, Cochrane reviews have evaluated the ef-
fectiveness of CBT for a variety of mental, physical, and
behavioral problems. Through a search of the Cochrane
Library database up to May 2021 [15], 124 disease con-
ditions were assessed to clarify the effects of CBT in ran-
domized controlled trials; the major conditions for
which CBT showed efficacy are listed in Table 1. These
include a broad range of medical problems such as psy-
chosomatic illnesses (e.g., chronic fatigue syndrome, ir-
ritable bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia), psychiatric
disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, and developmental
disability), and socio-behavioral problems (drug abuse,
smoking, and problem gambling). For most of these con-
ditions, CBT proved effective in the short term after
completion of the randomized controlled trial. Although
the number of literature was still limited, some studies
have reported significant and long-term treatment ef-
fects of CBT on some aspects of mental health like
obsessive-compulsive disorder [16] 1 year after the

completion of intervention. Future research should in-
vestigate the duration of CBT’s effects and ascertain the
optimal treatment intensity, including the number of
sessions.
Future directions for CBT application in
biopsychosocial domains
In Japan, CBT for mood disorders was first covered
under the National Health Insurance (NHI) in 2010, and
CBT for the following psychiatric disorders was subse-
quently added to the NHI scheme: obsessive–compulsive
disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, post-
traumatic stress disorder, and bulimia nervosa [17]. The
treatment outcomes and health insurance costs for these
six disorders should be analyzed as the first step, for ap-
propriate allocation of medical resources according to
disease severity and complexity [18]. In Japan, health in-
surance coverage is provided only when physicians apply
for remuneration. A system promoting nurse involve-
ment in CBT delivery [19], as well as shared responsibil-
ity
between
the
CBT
instructor
and
certified
psychologists (or even a complete shift from physicians
to psychologists), has yet to be established. Information
and communication technology (ICT) devices may allow
CBT delivery to be shared between medical staff and
psychologists,
in
medical,
community
and
self-help

settings [8]. The journal BioPsychoSocial Medicine pub-
lished 334 relevant articles up to the end of May 2021,
112 (33.5%) of which specifically addressed CBT [20].
CBT is a hot topic in biopsychosocial medicine, and
more research is required to encourage its application to
clinical and general populations.
