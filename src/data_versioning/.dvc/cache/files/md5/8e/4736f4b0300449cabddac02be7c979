In this study, we further developed prior research on risk and protective factors in 
adolescents’ mental health. More specifically, we used structural equation modelling to 
assess whether relationships at school with teachers and peers, and life satisfaction 
predicted mental health in a large sample of adolescents, while also testing for age and 
gender invariance. The sample comprised 3,895 adolescents (Mage =  16.7, SD  =  1.5, 
41.3% girls), who completed self-report instruments assessing their perceived life 
satisfaction, student-teacher relationship, school connectedness and mental health. 
Overall, the results suggested that life satisfaction acted as a mediator between 
adolescents’ positive school relations and their mental health. Outcomes were invariant 
across genders, while quality of school relations and mental health declined with age. 
Limitations of the study and futures lines in mental health research among adolescents 
are briefly discussed.

INTRODUCTION
According to the World Health Organization, mental health is ‘a state of well-being in which 
every individual realizes his or her own potential, copes with the normal stresses of life, works 
productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community’ (World 
Health Organization, 2005, p.  12). This definition recognises mental health as a dimension of 
overall health that spans a continuum from high-level wellness to severe illness, emphasising the 
key role of positive feelings, a sense of mastery and positive functioning (Galderisi et  al., 2015).
Adolescence is widely known to be  a sensitive period of exposure to a range of mental 
disorders whose incidence has been increasing in recent decades (Patton et  al., 2014; Erskine 
et  al., 2015). Indeed, approximately 20% of school students are now affected by diagnosable 
mental illnesses, with half of all mental issues developing by 14  years (Ford et  al., 2003; Gore 
et al., 2011). Data from studies with adolescents indicate that anxiety, depression, eating disorders, 
bipolar disorder, personality disorders, psychosis, addictive disorders, substance abuse, suicide 
attempts and self-harm are all becoming more frequent among this demographic (Paus et  al., 
2008; Twenge et  al., 2018; Burstein et  al., 2019). In most cases, disorders of this kind remain 
undetected and, consequently, untreated until later in life (Kessler et al., 2007; Patel et al., 2007). 
Furthermore, depression in young people is a highly prevalent illness worldwide, and suicide

is the third most frequent cause of death among adolescents 
in the United  States and Europe (World Health Organization, 
2012; Keyes et  al., 2019; Twenge, 2020).
The literature shows that adolescent mental health is influenced 
by both individual attributes and the everyday life contexts 
where adolescents grow up, including school, which is a key 
developmental setting (Weare and Nind, 2011; Cefai and Cavioni, 
2015). Students who experience mental health difficulties at 
school tend to exhibit poor school adjustment, reduced 
concentration, low achievement, problematic social relationships 
and a higher rate of health risk behaviours, such as substance 
use, school dropout and incurring expulsion (Valdez et  al., 
2011; Suldo et  al., 2014; Farina et  al., 2021).
Recent research also suggests that older adolescents may 
suffer a decline in mental health outcomes, with older girls 
reporting poorer mental health than older boys (Inchley 
et  al., 2020). This evidence has led to growing awareness of 
the need to address adolescents’ mental health requirements 
by identifying the factors that can promote or hinder their 
mental health in the school setting (Eccles and Roeser, 2011; 
Cavioni et  al., 2020a). Accordingly, the aim of this study 
was to investigate the role of life satisfaction and school 
relations, as protective and risk factors for mental health, 
in a large sample of adolescents.
PROTECTIVE AND RISK FACTORS 
ASSOCIATED WITH SCHOOL MENTAL 
HEALTH IN ADOLESCENCE
Protective factors for mental health may be defined as individual 
and environmental characteristics that foster healthy development 
but also reduce the negative impact of risk factors for mental 
health issues (Deković, 1999; O’Connell et al., 2009). In contrast, 
mental health risk factors can increase a person’s chances of 
developing psychological illness (World Health Organization, 
2012). In this research, we examined three factors that impact 
on adolescents’ mental health. The first is an individual factor, 
life satisfaction, while the second and third are school contextual 
factors, namely, student-teacher relationship and sense of 
community at school. Indeed, the literature on adolescent mental 
health is notably lacking in research on how the contextual 
factors associated with quality of school relationships interact 
with individual characteristics, such as life satisfaction, to shape 
mental health outcomes (Torsheim and Wold, 2001; Craig et al., 
2020). In the next section, we  review the existing research 
findings for each of these key factors.
Individual Factor: Life Satisfaction
Life satisfaction is defined as ‘the global assessment of a person’s 
quality of life according to his own chosen criteria’ (Andrews 
and Withey, 1976, p.  478). Numerous studies have found that 
adolescents with higher levels of life satisfaction display better 
school adaptive functioning, in terms of self-efficacy, self-esteem, 
engagement, academic achievement, social acceptance and peer 
relationships, as well as lower levels of school absenteeism, 
dropout and behavioural problems (Proctor et al., 2009; Fergusson 
et  al., 2015). Conversely, adolescents with low life satisfaction 
are more likely to display internalising and externalising problems, 
social stress and substance abuse (Zullig et  al., 2001; 
Haranin et  al., 2007).
Contextual Factors: Student-Teacher 
Relationship and Sense of Community at 
School
At the contextual level, multiple school-related factors have 
been associated with positive mental health outcomes in 
adolescents. More specifically, student-teacher relationship and 
sense of school community are known to serve as key protective 
factors via the provision of emotional and social support and 
safe environments (Eccles and Roeser, 2011). Overall, such 
contextual factors are associated with a lower likelihood of 
negative mental health outcomes, such as perceived stress, 
health complaints and unhealthy behavior (Lemma et al., 2014). 
In turn, adolescents with better mental health tend to display 
higher levels of attainment, decision-making ability, problem-
solving skills and academic achievement (Bonell et  al., 2014; 
Suldo et  al., 2014).
With regard to the student-teacher relationship, past research 
has generally assessed its positive and negative aspects and 
their implications for a wide range of student mental health 
outcomes. For example, Murray and Greenberg (2001) proposed 
that the relationship is formed of four components. Two concern 
the positive aspects of the relationship, which are affiliation 
with the teacher and a sense of bonding with school, and two 
its negative characteristics, which are dissatisfaction with the 
teacher and perceived school dangerousness. Studies on the 
positive aspects of the student-teacher relationship have shown 
that when it is characterised by warmth, respect, support and 
openness, it can have positive effects on students’ attitudes 
towards school, fostering an increased sense of belonging and 
more effective learning (Doll et  al., 2004; Suldo et  al., 2009). 
Pianta and colleagues have extensively documented the 
relationship between higher levels of attachment to teachers 
and bonding with the school and enhanced social and emotional 
skills, school satisfaction, engagement and motivation on the 
part of the students (e.g. Pianta, 1999; Pianta et  al., 2003; 
Pianta and Hamre, 2009). During adolescence, affiliation with 
teachers and bonds with the school can shield young people 
from the effects of stressful life events, promoting resilience 
and decreasing the likelihood of developing mental health issues, 
such as depression and misconduct (Murray and Greenberg, 
2001; Wang et al., 2013; Lemma et al., 2014; Cefai et al., 2015, 
2018; Höltge et  al., 2021). In contrast, dissatisfaction with 
teachers and perceived school dangerousness bear the potential 
to negatively affect mental health outcomes (Mameli et  al., 
2018). Indeed, studies with adolescents suggest that higher 
levels of dissatisfaction with teachers are associated with poor 
social functioning and increased peer problems, anxiety and 
somatic symptoms (Mameli et  al., 2018), whereas perceptions 
of poor school safety are linked with internalising and 
externalising behavior problems and bullying (Nijs et al., 2014).

The sense of community in a school, also termed ‘school 
connectedness’ or ‘belongingness in the school’, is the other 
contextual factor that we  view as a significant marker for 
mental health. It may be defined as ‘the extent to which students 
feel personally accepted, respected, included, and supported 
by others in the school social environment’ (Goodenow, 1993, 
p. 80). Numerous scholars have examined the impact of sense 
of community on adolescent mental health, finding that school 
connectedness is positively associated with healthy behaviours, 
school engagement and adjustment, motivation, school 
attendance, conflict resolution skills and prosocial behavior 
(Vieno et al., 2005; Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 
2009). Conversely, sense of community is negatively associated 
with school absenteeism, loneliness, worry, social isolation, 
emotional distress, antisocial and risky behaviours, violence, 
delinquency, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts (Hirschi, 
1969; Pretty et  al., 1994; Joyce and Early, 2014).
Age and Gender Differences in Mental 
Health Outcomes
Cohort studies with adolescent samples indicate that the incidence 
of mental health disorders increases with age, especially emotional 
and conduct disorders, and psychosomatic problems (Bell et al., 
2019). According to the recent Health Behavior in School-aged 
Children report, adolescents’ quality of school relationships 
and school belonging worsen over time. In contrast, younger 
adolescents report higher levels of life satisfaction and better 
mental health (Inchley et  al., 2020).
With respect to gender, research has long shown that adolescent 
males and females tend to display different mental health patterns 
in relation to internalising and externalising behavioural problems 
(Yeo et  al., 2007; Nijs et  al., 2014). For example, various studies 
have found that girls display more frequent and intense internalising 
behaviours, such as stress and anxiety (e.g. concerning interpersonal 
relationships, school demands, family relationships, and personal 
and social adjustment), as well as a higher risk of developing 
depression compared to males (Angold and Rutter, 1992; Compas 
et al., 1993; Nolen-Hoeksema and Girgus, 1994). On the contrary, 
male adolescents are more prone to externalising behaviours, 
such as school problems, aggressive behavior and difficulty in 
managing negative emotions (Stark et  al., 1989; van der Ende 
and Verhulst, 2005).
RESEARCH AIMS AND HYPOTHESIS
Although the existing research offers insights into the role 
played by individual and contextual factors in secondary school 
students’ mental health, most previous studies have taken a 
deficit-based approach by focusing on the impact of negative 
factors (Ben-Arieh, 2000; Antaramian et al., 2010). Consequently, 
a number of authors have pointed out the need to focus on 
the role of both risk and protective factors and how they 
simultaneously impact on mental health (e.g. Seligman and 
Csikszentmihalyi, 2000; Terjesen et  al., 2004). Furthermore, 
despite growing awareness of the importance of relational 
experience at school, relatively few studies have focused on 
the quality of students’ social relationships with teachers and 
peers and its impact on overall mental health during adolescence 
(Torsheim and Wold, 2001; Gaete et  al., 2016).
To address this gap, we  set out to extend the recent 
literature on school-related factors in adolescents’ mental 
health by focusing on both protective and risk factors. More 
specifically, we used structural equation modelling (SEM) to 
evaluate the contributions of quality of school relations and 
life satisfaction to the mental health of a large group of 
adolescents. The model was also specified to control for 
effects of age, whereas a multigroup invariance test was 
conducted to assess differences as a function of gender. The 
conceptual model is illustrated in Figure  1.

Specifically, we  expected that positive relations at school, 
in terms of affiliation with teachers, bonds with school and 
sense of school community, would be positively associated with 
both life satisfaction and mental health (Hypothesis 1); moreover, 
we predicted that negative relationships, in terms of dissatisfaction 
with teachers and a perception of school dangerousness, would 
be  negatively associated with both life satisfaction and mental 
health (Hypothesis 2). In addition, we  planned to conduct a 
multigroup invariance test to assess whether were differences 
between boys and girls in terms of the magnitude of the 
predicted associations. Notably, while past studies have examined 
gender differences in relation to life satisfaction and mental 
health, little research to date has attempted to model these 
variables in relation to the quality of young people’s relationships 
at school.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants and Procedures
The head teachers of 20 high schools located in two regions 
of Northern Italy (Lombardy and Piedmont) were contacted 
via email or by telephone and informed about the aims of 
the study and the research procedure. Seventeen schools agreed 
to participate in the study. A briefing letter was sent to the 
students’ parents. Informed consent and GDPR consent were 
obtained from all respondents and from their parents (who 
were free to deny their child’s participation in the study). Data 
were collected anonymously, and students were free to withdraw 
at any time during the administration of the questionnaire. 
Seventeen parents refused permission for their child to participate 
in the study; 11 students were absent during data collection, 
and four declined to participate.
Students responded to a set of online questionnaires in the 
classroom during regular school hours. The entire battery of 
instruments took about 15 min to complete. The questionnaires 
were presented in random order to minimise potential sources 
of measurement error (Franke, 1997). Data collection was 
managed by the lead researcher and two research assistants, 
who presented the aims of the study to the students before 
administering the questionnaires.
A sample of 3,895 students (41.3% girls) completed the 
research instruments. Following a review of missing data, no 
questionnaires were removed from the analysis due to the use 
of mandatory fields in the online data collection. The final 
sample, aged between 15 and 19 years (M  =  16.7, SD  =  1.5), 
included students from all three branches of the Italian high 
school system: professional institutes, technical institutes and 
lyceums. Almost half the participants (48%) were enrolled at 
lyceums (academic track), compared to 25.1 and 26.9% who 
attended professional and technical schools (vocational track), 
respectively. The majority (88.7%) were Italian citizens (i.e., 
born in Italy of Italian parents), while 11.3% came from 
non-Italian ethno-cultural backgrounds (parents not Italian 
and/or not born in Italy). The study was approved by the 
Ethical Committee of Milano-Bicocca University and was 
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Measures
Demographics
Participants were asked to specify their age, gender, school 
grade and nationality.
Life Satisfaction
The Italian translation of the abbreviated Multidimensional 
Students’ Life Satisfaction Scale (MSLSS) was used to assess 
life satisfaction (Huebner, 1994; Huebner et al., 1998; Zappulla 
et al., 2014). The MSLSS is a thirty-item self-report questionnaire 
that measures children’s and adolescents’ life satisfaction in 
five domains: family (e.g. ‘I enjoy being at home with my 
family’), friends (e.g. ‘My friends treat me well’), school (e.g. 
‘I look forward to going to school’), self (e.g. ‘Most people 
like me’) and living environment (‘My family’s house is nice’). 
Respondents are asked to rate items on a 6-point Likert scale, 
ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). Previous 
studies with adolescent samples yielded acceptable validity and 
reliability coefficients across the five domains with alphas ranging 
from 0.71 to 0.91 (Gilligan and Huebner, 2007; Sawatzky et al., 
2009; Huebner et  al., 2012; Zappulla et  al., 2014). Cronbach’s 
reliability values for the present study were as follows: family 
(α  =  0.89), friend (α  =  0.85), environment (α  =  0.75), self 
(α  =  0.73) and school (α  =  0.79).
Student-Teacher Relationship
Students’ perceptions of their relationships with teachers and 
bonds with school were evaluated using the Italian version of 
the Student-Teacher Relationship Questionnaire (STRQ; Tonci 
et  al., 2012) developed by Murray and Greenberg (2001). The 
STRQ comprises 22 items to be  rated on a 4-point Likert 
scale (from 1 = almost never or never true to 4 = almost 
always or always true). The questionnaire evaluates the quality 
of individual students’ relationships with their teachers and 
their perceptions of their school environment in terms of four 
factors: affiliation with teacher (e.g. ‘My teachers pay a lot of 
attention to me’), dissatisfaction with teachers (e.g. ‘I feel angry 
with my teacher’), bonds with school (e.g. ‘I feel safe at my 
school’) and school dangerousness (e.g. ‘My school is a dangerous 
place to be’). The four factors have been found to be  reliable, 
with Cronbach’s alphas ranging between 0.66 and 0.88 (Murray 
and Greenberg, 2001). Cronbach’s reliability values in the present 
study were as follows: affiliation (α  =  0.84), bonds (α  =  0.71), 
dangerousness (α  =  0.66) and dissatisfaction (α  =  0.74).
Sense of Community in School
Students’ sense of community was assessed via the Italian 
version of the Students’ Sense of Community in School scale 
(Vieno et  al., 2005), originally developed by Samdal et  al. 
(1998). The questionnaire comprises six items (e.g. ‘I feel 
I belong at this school’) designed to assess the three dimensions 
of sense of community (membership, shared emotional 
connection and fulfilment of needs) identified by McMillan 
and Chavis (1986). Responses are rated on a 5-point Likert 
scale (from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). In 
previous studies, this questionnaire displayed satisfactory internal

reliability with alphas ranging between 0.71 and 0.82 (Vieno 
et  al., 2005; Prati et  al., 2020). Cronbach’s reliability value for 
the present study was α=0.75.
Mental Health
The Italian validated version of the Mental Health Continuum 
Short Form (MHC-SF) was used to assess respondent’ mental 
health (Petrillo et al., 2015). This instrument, originally developed 
by Keyes (2002), is a self-report questionnaire comprising 14 
items. Informed by Keyes’ theoretical model of mental health 
(Keyes, 1998, 2002, 2005, 2007; Keyes and Waterman, 2003), 
the MHC-SF evaluates three dimensions of mental health: 
emotional (e.g. ‘How often did you  feel happy?’), social (e.g. 
‘How often did you  feel that you  had something important 
to contribute to society?’) and psychological (e.g. ‘How often 
did you  feel good at managing the responsibilities of your 
daily life?’). Items are rated on a 6-point Likert scale ranging 
from 0 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the time), based on 
respondents’ experience over the preceding month. Total scores 
on the MHC-SF range from 0 to 70, with higher scores reflecting 
better mental health. Among adolescents, the MHC-SF has 
displayed validity and satisfactory internal reliability values 
ranging from 0.75 to 0.91 (Lim, 2014; Petrillo et  al., 2014, 
2015; Luijten et  al., 2019; Reinhardt et  al., 2020). Cronbach’s 
reliability values for the present study were as follows: emotional 
(α  =  0.81), social (α  =  0.78) and psychological (α  =  0.83).
Statistical Analysis and SEM
In order to test the network of associations between adolescents’ 
mental health and the other study variables, we  adopted a 
SEM approach (Thakkar, 2020). SEM techniques are based on 
multivariate data analysis and combine empirical measurement 
with theoretical inquiry by allowing latent factors to be estimated 
along with patterns of associations among observed variables 
(Guo et  al., 2009; Cavioni et al., 2020b; Farina et  al., 2020; 
Veronese et al., 2020). SEM permits estimation of the magnitude 
and direction of paths among variables and the evaluation of 
total, direct and indirect effects (Hair et  al., 2017).
It is essentially a method of testing hypotheses via a 
confirmatory rather than an exploratory approach. In the present 
paper, we  estimated a model with four latent variables and 
13 empirical indicators (see Figure  1).
Moving from left to right in the figure, two of the latent 
constructs were positive and negative school relationships as 
operationalised by five empirical indicators: affiliation with 
teachers, bonds with school, sense of community, dissatisfaction 
with school and school dangerousness. Next, life satisfaction 
was assessed in relation to four domains: self, friends, family 
and environment. The school domain of the MSLSS was omitted 
from the analysis due to its collinearity with other latent 
variables (e.g. positive and negative school relations). Finally, 
the target latent variable mental health was modelled via its 
psychological, emotional and social dimensions. In line with 
the research hypotheses, we  estimated the direct effects of 
positive and negative school relations on both life satisfaction 
and mental health. All variables were viewed as endogenous 
conceptual components of the model, whereas participants’ age 
was modelled as an exogenous variable. Estimated total effects 
were broken down into direct and indirect effects (Kline, 2015).
Following standard procedures for SEM, we  evaluated the 
following goodness-of-fit indices: root mean square error of 
approximation (RMSEA; RMSEA < 0.05; Madeu-Olivares et al., 
2018), standardised root mean square residual (SRMR; 
SRMR  <  0.05) (Sass et  al., 2014); normed fit index (NFI; 
NFI  >  0.95; Marsh et  al., 2013), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI; 
TLI  >  0.95; Morin et  al., 2013) and comparative fit index 
(CFI; CFI > 0.95; Morin et al., 2013). As currently recommended 
(e.g. Bollen and Long, 1993; Kaplan and Depaoli, 2012) for 
SEM, we used both Monte Carlo simulation and bootstrapping 
methods to estimate confidence limits with a set of random 
samples (k  =  500). We  calculated the given indirect effects 
for each of the k samples and the mean value for the selected 
pool of samples. Finally, we conducted a multigroup invariance 
test (MGCFA) to determine whether similar response patterns 
were obtained across gender-based cohorts. The MGCFA also 
helped us to specify the model structure with the best potential 
for generalisation (Brown et  al., 2017). The hypothesis of 
measurement invariance was to be  accepted if configural 
invariance (all parameters free to vary but structural model 
held constant), metric invariance (factor loadings set to be equal 
in both groups), scalar invariance (factor loadings and item 
intercepts constrained) and full invariance (all parameters were 
equivalent across the groups) were all supported. Structural 
equivalence was to be  rejected if the indexed variations were 
statistically significant. The cut-off points (CFI, RMSEA and 
SRMR) for rejecting measurement invariance were set at 
Δ  =  0.01, corresponding to a p level of 0.01 (Chen, 2007).
We also estimated Mahalanobis’ distance (p < 0.001) to detect 
potentially multivariate outliers; no cases needed to be  removed 
from the dataset. Finally, we assessed the distribution of the data 
for each of the study measures. None of the kurtosis or skewness 
values exceeded the recommended limits [−1,+1], and consequently, 
the maximum likelihood method (Gath and Hayes, 2006) was 
adopted to estimate the parameters for the SEM analysis. The 
software used for all analyses was Amos 23.0 (Arbuckle, 2014).
RESULTS
Table  1 provides a summary of the main descriptive statistics 
for the variables under study (e.g. mean values and standard 
deviations), along with their zero-order correlations.
In general, the zero-order correlations revealed statistically 
significant, robustly positive patterns of association between 
mental health and positive school relations, with r values 
ranging between 0.382 (psychological mental health and bonds) 
and 0.311 (social mental health and affiliation). Furthermore, 
mental health was negatively associated with negative relations, 
with an especially robust association between dissatisfaction 
and the psychological dimension of mental health. However, 
the strongest patterns of association in terms of statistical 
significance and magnitude of effect were observed between 
mental health and life satisfaction, with values ranging between 
Cavioni et al.

0.622 (psychological mental health and satisfaction with self) 
and 0.379 (social mental health and satisfaction with friends). 
With regard to demographic variables, age was found to 
be  negatively associated with all aspects of mental health and 
life satisfaction, while mixed patterns of association were found 
between age and school relations. Concerning gender differences, 
zero-order correlations were generally low or not statistically 
significant, with the exception of bonds with school (r = −0.108), 
a measure on which boys scored more poorly than girls. Overall, 
the correlational analysis provided support for testing a structural 
equation model with all the study variables.
The fit analysis (see Figure  1) suggested that the empirical 
data provided a good fit for conceptual model. All the fit 
indexes endorsed the full acceptance of the model: NFI = 0.954, 
NNFI = 0.954, CFI = 0.956, RMSEA = 0.066 [C.I. 90th = 0.063–
0.070] and SRMR = 0.041. Total, direct and indirect standardised 
effects are reported in Table 2. Indirect effects reflect interaction 
among three variables, while a direct effect represents the 
impact of a single determinant on a given target variable.
Again, moving from left to right, the latent variable, positive 
school relations, had significant effects on both life satisfaction 
(β  =  0.478) and mental health (β  =  0.435). Interestingly, the 
direct pathway between positive relations and mental health 
was negligible and non-significant (β  =  0.042), meaning that 
life satisfaction fully mediated the association between these 
two variables (the magnitude of the indirect effect was 0.393). 
Negative school relations had significant total effects on both 
life satisfaction (β  =  − 0.088) and mental health (β  =  −0.151), 
although the magnitude of these effects was small compared 
to the effects of positive relationships. Finally, a large, statistically 
significant, positive pathway was observed from life satisfaction 
to mental health (β  =  0.845). In terms of pathways between 
age and latent variables, older adolescents generally reported 
weaker positive relations (β  =  −0.191), poorer mental health 
(β  =  −0.05) and stronger negative relations (β  =  0.053). In 
contrast, no statistically significant pathway was found between 
age and life satisfaction. The results of the invariance test of 
gender-based cohorts of adolescents are reported in Table  3 
and Figure  2.
The main outcome of the invariance analysis was that the 
structural equation model supported the first two levels of 
invariance between boys and girls. Specifically, only configural 
and metric invariance were confirmed, meaning that the theorised 
set of variables and pathways held in the two groups, but 
males and females obtained different intercept values. Although 
the set of pathways remained substantially the same in the 
two cohorts of adolescents, there were minor differences 
concerning the latent variable negative relations: specifically, 
there was a small inverse association (β  =  −0.109) between 
negative relations and life satisfaction for girls, but this pathway 
was not statistically significant for boys.
DISCUSSION
The main aim of the present study was to investigate – via 
SEM – whether and to what extent quality of school relations

and life satisfaction predicted mental health in a large sample 
of adolescents. We  obtained the following key findings, 
which are discussed below in further detail. First, we found 
strong associations between the quality of adolescents’ school 
relations, their life satisfaction and their mental health. 
Second, life satisfaction, which was positively associated 
with mental health, was found to act as mediator between 
adolescents’ positive relationships and their mental health. 
Third, both the quality of school relations and life satisfaction 
appeared to protect mental health, and this outcome did 
not significantly vary as a function of gender. Finally, students’ 
quality of school relations and mental health deteriorated 
with age.
Associations Among Quality of School 
Relations, Life Satisfaction and Mental 
Health
The first main outcome confirmed our leading research 
hypothesis, namely that positive school relations, in terms 
of affiliation with teachers, bond with school and sense of 
community, would be positively associated with mental health 
and life satisfaction. The second hypothesis was also borne 
out by the data: specifically, negative school relations, in 
terms of dissatisfaction with teachers and perceptions of 
school dangerousness, were negatively associated with life 
satisfaction and mental health. The structural equational 
model also indicated that the quality of school relations – 
operationalised via affiliation with teachers, bonds with school 
and sense of community – was associated with adolescents’ 
mental health. Although the literature acknowledges the 
importance of students’ social and relational experience, and 
especially the role of teachers in promoting it (e.g. Pianta, 1999; 
Roorda et  al., 2011; Cavioni et  al., 2017), few recent studies 
have been focused on how these factors may be  related to 
one another during adolescence. Our findings also underscored 
the key role of student-teacher relationships, especially in 
the high school setting where they tend to become more 
impersonal (Roorda et  al., 2011). This is in line with recent 
work by Ibrahim and El Zaatari (2020), who concluded that 
teacher-student 
relationships 
are 
the 
most 
important 
relationship in the school context and have positive effects 
on students’ mental health when characterised by empathy, 
closeness, love, care, support, respect and reciprocity. Another 
remarkable outcome of our model concerns the impact of 
adolescents’ self-perceived bonds with their school and sense 
of community at school on mental health. Although existing 
studies have examined the association between adolescents’ 
school bonds and sense of community on mental health, 
traditionally the focus has been on their role in reducing 
emotional and conduct issues, hyperactivity, peer problems, 
depression and anxiety (Lester et  al., 2013; Gaete et  al., 
2016). Our findings, on the other hand, offer the novel insight 
that students’ school bonds and sense of community actually 
act as preventive factors. Consequently, mental health in 
schools needs to be  promoted by building collective beliefs, 
values and expectations among students, teachers and all 
members of the school community. Overall, these outcomes 
are consistent with the positive psychology approach, which 
emphasises the importance of identifying and fostering positive 
indicators of mental health rather than merely detecting and 
seeking to mitigate factors that cause psychopathology 
(Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi, 2000; Antaramian et al., 2008).

The Moderating Role of Life Satisfaction
Our second finding was that life satisfaction played a key 
mediating role between adolescents’ positive relationships at 
school and their mental health. In our model, life satisfaction 
was operationalised as adolescents’ subjective cognitive appraisal 
of their quality of life in the domains of self, environment, 
friends and family. We  set out to investigate how contextual 
factors at school interact with individual characteristics to shape 
adolescents’ mental health, and our results suggest that life 
satisfaction, conceptualised as an individual factor, may play 
a significant part in this process. In addition, although the 
association between life satisfaction and mental health has been 
widely examined in adult populations, few studies have explored 
this aspect among adolescents. Existing research conducted with 
teenage samples has been focused on life satisfaction as a buffer 
against negative life events and stress, and the development 
of externalising and internalising behavioural problems (McKnight 
et  al., 2002; Suldo and Huebner, 2004; Sawatzky et  al., 2010). 
Our results suggest that life satisfaction for adolescents not 
only acts as a barrier mitigating the impact of negative events 
and mental health problems (Lazarus, 1991; Suldo and Huebner, 
2004) but also represents a key psychological resource through 
which positive relationships can boost mental health.
Gender Invariance
Overall, we  identified minor gender differences in the relative 
strength of the associations among the variables. Previous 
studies with adolescents mainly examined the role of gender 
in terms of differential patterns of internalising and externalising 
behavioural problems in boys versus girls (e.g. van der Ende 
and Verhulst, 2005). However, in this study, we  explored the 
role of gender by applying a multigroup invariance test to 
compare the performance of our conceptual model across 
gender groups (Ornaghi et  al., 2016). Our structural equation 
model was aimed at identifying contextual and individual 
resources that contribute to mental health rather than comparing 
psychological symptoms between genders. The results suggested 
that positive school relations and life satisfaction protect the 
school mental health of both girls and boys.
Age Invariance
We found that older students reported weaker positive school 
relations and poorer mental health, along with a higher incidence 
of negative school relations. These findings are consistent with 
previous studies that have identified declines over time in 
adolescents’ mental health outcomes as well as in their perceptions 
of emotional support from teachers (Eccles and Roeser, 2011; 
Bayram Özdemir and Özdemir, 2020). Given that adolescence 
is a major life period marked by numerous individual and 
contextual challenges with the potential to impact on adolescents’ 
mental health (Dwivedi and Harper, 2004; Grazzani Gavazzi 
et al., 2011), our results add to our understanding of the 
association between school relations and mental health across 
age groups, confirming that student mental health hits its lowest 
point during late adolescence.
Limitation and Future Studies
Some limitations of this study should be noted. First, although 
we  analysed data from a large sample of adolescents, the 
outcomes cannot be  generalised to early adolescence nor to 
adolescents with atypical development. Second, the study was 
conducted on a sample of adolescents mainly enrolled at 
lyceums. Consequently, the findings can be  generalised with 
caution to the whole population of high school students attending 
professional and technical institutes. Third, given that the present 
data were collected in Italian schools from only two regions, 
the outcome could not be automatically extended to adolescents 
from the whole Italian Country.

Finally, while we  examined the impact of school relations 
and life satisfaction on adolescents’ mental health at a single 
time point, relationships at school are never static. We, therefore, 
recommend that the future research adopt a longitudinal design 
to investigate how the contribution of the school relationships 
to young people’s mental health may evolve over time.
