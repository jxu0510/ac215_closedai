Background: There is growing evidence and awareness regarding the magnitude of
mental health issues across the globe, starting half of those before the age of 14 and
have lifelong effects on individuals and society. Despite the multidimensional nature
of this global challenge, which necessarily require comprehensive approaches, many
interventions persist in seeking solutions that only tackle the individual level. The aim of
this paper is to provide a systematic review of evidence for positive effects in children
and adolescents’ mental health resulting from interventions conducted in schools and
communities in which interaction among different agents is an integral component.
Methods: An extensive search in electronic databases (Web of Knowledge, SCOPUS,
ERIC, and PsycINFO) was conducted to identify interventions in which interactions
between peers, teachers, families or other community members or professionals played
a role. Their effects on children and adolescents’ mental health were also reviewed. We
carried out a systematic review of papers published from 2007 to 2017. Eleven studies
out of 384 met the inclusion criteria. Seven of the articles reviewed focus on interventions
conducted in schools and promote supportive interactions involving students, teachers,
families and mental health professionals. Four of the articles develop interventions that
engage community members in dialogic interactions with children and adolescents.
Results:
Interventions in schools and communities implement strategies that foster
supportive interactions among diverse actors including teachers, parents, community
members, and other professionals. The effects of the mental health interventions reported
on children and adolescents’ problems include a decrease in disruptive behaviors and
affective symptoms such as depression and anxiety, together with an increase in social
skills, as well as an improvement in personal well-being.
Conclusions: There is evidence of a positive effect on the mental health of children
and adolescents, both in decreasing symptoms of mental disorder and in promoting
emotional well-being. Whereas, interactions among different actors seem to be a relevant
aspect across the interventions, more research is needed to conclude its effect on the
outcomes of the studies reviewed.

Interaction-Based Interventions for Mental Health
INTRODUCTION
Childhood and adolescence are critical periods to promote
mental health as more than half of mental health problems
start at these stages, and many of these persist throughout
adult life (Kessler et al., 2005). Currently, this has become a
priority as worldwide data shows an increase in the prevalence
of mental health issues in childhood and adolescence (de la
Barra M, 2009) and the percentage of those aﬄicted reaching
nearly 20% (WHO, 2016). The situation is further exacerbated
by the fact that many of these children and adolescents are not
receiving the specialized care they require (Mills et al., 2006;
Weist and Murray, 2008; Green et al., 2013).
Consequently, important eﬀorts to bring together the best
evidence about mental health have been done and raised the
challenge of agreeing about fundamental issues in the ﬁeld such as
the deﬁnition of mental health and other related concepts (Mehta
et al., 2015). According to WHO, mental health is understood not
as a mere absence of illness, but rather, in a broader sense, as a
state of well-being in which individuals develop their abilities,
face the stress of daily life, perform productive and fruitful
work, and contribute to the betterment of their community
(WHO, 2004). This deﬁnition served as the basis for WHO
Mental Health Action Plan, 2013–2020, which incorporates the
concepts of mental health promotion, mental illness prevention
and treatment, and rehabilitation. Particularly, developmental
aspects of children and young people, including, for instance, the
ability to manage thoughts, emotions, as well as to build social
relationships, and the aptitude to learn, are emphasized in the
plan as critical facets to be tackled in mental health interventions.
Mental health interventions conducted in schools and in
the communities start from the premise that the problems
experienced by adolescents are determined by the interaction
of individual, environmental and family factors (Manjula,
2015). Accordingly, schools and communities oﬀer an optimal
context to intervene as children and adolescents grow and
develop through social interaction. Schools and communities
can make the most of its environment to foster child and
youth development and to promote good mental health (Weist
and Murray, 2008). Many of the mental health programs
implemented in schools promote the development of social skills,
socio-emotional competences, and learning outcomes while at
the same time reducing disruptive behavior (Dowdy et al.,
2010; Moreira et al., 2010; Durlak et al., 2011; Suldo et al.,
2014). The school environment and climate can therefore play a
critical role in encouraging the promotion of protective factors
for mental health, such as social-emotional competences and
skills (Osher et al., 2012).
Hence, social and cognitive development is enacted through
social interactions in a particular cultural and social context
(Vygotsky, 1978; Bronfenbrenner, 1979). Drawing on the
contributions of Vygotsky’s theory of cognitive development,
human interaction that takes place in the social and cultural
context enhances learning and is fundamental for psychological
function. These cultural processes in which people learn
and
developed
occur
through
interactions
with
others,
including
symmetrical
(peer)
as
well
as
expert–novice
(e.g., teacher–student) relations (Rogoﬀ, 1990; Cole, 1996).
Importantly, speciﬁc instruments have been produced to
capture
productive
forms
of
dialogue
across
educational
contexts (Hennessy et al., 2016)
Most of the research have been devoted to understanding the
central role played by the quality of dialogue and interaction
between students, in small group classrooms, or in whole class
setting teacher-student interaction (see review by Howe and
Abedin, 2013). Furthermore, research conducted in community-
based schools has also reported the beneﬁt of involving
families and community members in learning interactions with
elementary students, especially for those belonging to vulnerable
populations (Flecha and Soler, 2013; Valls and Kyriakides, 2013).
Accordingly, community plays a central role as human develop
through their interactions in the sociocultural activities of their
communities (Rogoﬀ, 2003). Similar improvements have been
reported among students with disabilities as a result of engaging
in caring and supportive interactions among peers and with other
adults when solving academic tasks in interactive groups (García-
Carrión et al., 2018). The relevance of productive forms of
dialogue and supportive interactions among peers, teachers and
other community members, have also reported positive eﬀects
in 4th grade students prosocial behavior (Villardón-Gallego
et al., 2018).These studies evidence the potential of educational
interventions that draw on the potential of fostering interactions
among diﬀerent agents and promote productive dialogues as a
tools for academic and social improvement.
However, when searching for mental health improvement
through dialogic interactions, the research is scarce. The
pioneering
study
carried
out
by
Seikkula
and
Arnkil
(2006) showed the psychological and social beneﬁts of the
therapy based on open and anticipation dialogues with adults
and adolescents that also involved the family along with the
professionals. Rather than focusing in the individual, facilitating
supportive interactions among peers, professionals and family
members might be an asset underpinning mental health
interventions with children and adolescents. This study showed
the critical role of collective interactions, which were very
diﬀerent from a dialogue between two individuals (Seikkula and
Arnkil, 2006). They identiﬁed multi-system treatments (MST)
characterized by engaging in close interaction professionals with
adolescents, family, and other networks. Replication of these US
studies in Norway found evidence of eﬀectiveness, particularly,
in the adolescents’ social skills (Ogden and Halliday-Boykins,
2004). However, according to Seikkula and Arnkil (2006, p.
181): “what ultimately caused the observed outcome was not
revealed. After all, methods do not help or cure anyone as such.
Psychological methods -and other interaction-based means-
exist as they user activity.”
Whereas, determining the eﬀect of the interaction itself in
the outcomes obtained might be problematic, the authors of
these paper aim to examine interaction-based mental health
interventions, deﬁned as those in which collective interactions,
that involve professionals, family and community members
with children and adolescents, are an integral component
of the intervention. This systematic review focuses on those
interventions conducted in schools and communities and its
outcomes on children and adolescents’ mental health. According
to the WHO deﬁnition of mental health provided above, primary

Interaction-Based Interventions for Mental Health
studies selected for this review will include positive outcomes in a
broader sense, comprising not only the reduction of symptoms of
mental disorder but also the promotion of emotional well-being.
METHODS
The study carries out a systematic review (Gough et al., 2013),
a methodology developed by the EPPI Centre of the UCL
Institute of Education. We have also taken into account the
recommendations by PRISMA (Moher et al., 2009) and checklist
by Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) (Lockwood et al., 2015), in
order to oﬀer transparency, validity, replicable, and updateable
in this study.
Search Strategy
This systematic review has been focused and deﬁned by the
question: Do interaction-based mental health interventions
in schools and communities have positive eﬀects among
children and adolescents? This question has been deﬁned in
terms of PICOS: In children and adolescents (Population)
are interaction-based interventions (Intervention) eﬀective in
decreasing disruptive behaviors and aﬀective symptoms such
as depression and anxiety (in children and adolescents with
mental health problems), and in increasing social skills, and
improving well-being and academic engagement (in children and
adolescents in general)? (Outcomes).
For the review, empirical articles published in international
scientiﬁc journals in the areas of psychology, education, and
mental health and focused on interventions among children
and youth between 2007 and 2017 were searched and screened.
To that eﬀect, the following databases were analyzed: Web of
Knowledge, SCOPUS, ERIC, and PsycINFO.
The articles were searched using the following keywords:
“school-based,”
“community-based,”
“dialogue,”
“mental
health,” “well-being,” “emotional development,” “interventions,”
“program,” “interaction,” and “prevention.” The exploration was
completed with searches that employed synonyms or derivatives
of the keywords. The keywords were also combined to reﬁne
the search. The publications containing the search criteria in the
title, in the keywords and in the abstract were include.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
In order to identify and select the studies most relevant to our
research, inclusion and exclusion criteria were established.
The inclusion criteria were the following:
- Special population group: children and adolescents.
- Target age: 6 to 18 years of age, inclusive.
- Mental health interventions in which collective interactions,
including professionals, families, and community members
with children and adolescents, are an integral component.
- Studies reporting outcomes of the intervention in decreasing
symptoms and/or promoting well-being.
The exclusion criteria were the following:
- Interventions focus on early childhood, youth, or adults.
- Target age is not speciﬁed, or the target population is below 5
or above 18 years.
- Mental
health
interventions
focusing
on
one-to-one
interactions (i.e., professional-child/professional-adolescent).
- The intervention is not described or assessed, as in trials,
theoretical research or literature reviews.
Selection Process
The ﬁrst part of the search yielded a total of 384 articles from
indexed journals: 183 in published in the WOS database, 12
in Scopus, 33 in ERIC and 156 in PsycINFO. All these articles
were entered into the Mendeley software for its screening and
review. Basic information such as the title, year, authoring, and
abstracts was obtained and introduced in a spreadsheet for a
ﬁrst screening.
From the 384 articles gathered in the initial search, the titles
and their authors were subsequently revised in order to eliminate
duplicates. This review was carried out by the members of the
group independently in order to eliminate duplicate documents,
speciﬁcally 83 were duplicates and were therefore discarded,
resulting in a new total of 301 articles.
Abstracts of the 301 articles were reviewed according to the
inclusion and exclusion criteria. As a result, 17 articles initially
met the inclusion criteria and were eligible for the review (see
Figure 1). The articles were downloaded for an in-depth review.
The three researchers examined the articles independently and
extracted the most relevant information that was included in a
spreadsheet. The information referred to: (a) study characteristics
(author, country, selection criteria, design, data acquisition
period), (b) population (target population, age and sample size),
(c) settings, and (d) type of study. Once the articles were
examined in depth against inclusion and exclusion criteria,
discrepancies were discussed to reach a consensus in the ﬁnal
selection of the studies. This ﬁrst review and discussion of the
studies of the 11 articles lead to the elimination of a further six
articles that did not adequately ﬁt the inclusion criteria. Thus, a
total of 11 articles were ﬁnally selected for analysis (Figure 1).
Quality Assessment
The quality of the selected studies was assessed using a checklist
following the methodological guidance for systematic reviews
developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) (Lockwood et al.,
2015). The selected studies were checked against nine questions.
The results of the evaluation are presented in the Table 1.
Data Analysis
For the analysis of the studies, the three researchers developed
an analytical grid to systematize the most relevant information
for the purpose of the review: study characteristics, interactions
fostered during the intervention, positive eﬀects and information
for assessment of the risk of bias. Each researcher analyzed the
studies independently aiming at identifying on the one hand,
how the interventions promote interactions between diﬀerent
agents, and on the other hand, the eﬀects of the interventions on
the target population. Firstly, data was categorized following an
inductive method. Secondly, researchers compared their analysis
to reach a consensus to report main ﬁndings from the review.

RESULTS
The analysis of 11 mental health interventions targeting children
and adolescents reported the beneﬁts for both -students with
mental health problems as well as healthy participants- resulting
from their participation in the programs analyzed. Nine of
the studies show the eﬀects of preventive interventions aim to
reduce future problems and to promote mental health among
children and adolescents without mental health problems. Only
two studies target children who had already contacted the school-
based mental health service (Fazel, 2015) and adolescents who
presented depressive symptoms (Connell and Dishion, 2008).
Overall, the articles reviewed show a series of studies conducted
mainly in the US context, seven out of ten, whereas the rest of
the studies were carried out in the United Kingdom and Kenya.
Seven of the interventions were conducted in schools and four of
them were based in the community.
All the studies have shown to promote positive mental
health in increasing well-being and preventing other related
problems, as well as in reducing aﬀective symptoms among
those participants who were already aﬀected. A detailed
analysis of the strategies implemented across the mental health
programs revealed an emphasis on fostering interactions among
the children and adolescents engaging them in dialogues

selected is provided in Table 2.
Supportive Interactions in Mental Health
Interventions
Interactions among students, teachers, family, and community
members and other professionals play an important role in the
interventions analyzed. The mental health programs developed
in schools and communities include speciﬁc strategies that have
an emphasis on enacting peer support, partnerships and dialogic
spaces for the children and adolescents to engage in supportive
interactions with other relevant peers or adults.
Collaborative Interactions Among Children, Teachers
and Parents in the School Context
Interactions between teachers and students underpin the
strategies of the mental health interventions in diﬀerent speciﬁc
ways, which include tutoring, interviews, consultation meetings,
peer-assisted learning strategies, interactive games, cooperative
non-competitive building games, among others. (Bradshaw et al.,
2009; Houlston et al., 2011; Cappella et al., 2012; Ohl et al.,
2013; Atkins et al., 2015; Fazel, 2015). Overall, ﬁve of the studies
implement strategies aim at developing children social skills
through interaction and collaboration.
Similarly,
interventions
focus
on
“group
interactions”
as a preventive strategy that seek to reduce future mental
health problems and to promote well-being (McWhirter and
McWhirter, 2010). Speciﬁcally, two group-oriented prevention
programs—Project
Family
Rejuvenation
Education
and
Empowerment and Group-Oriented Psychological Education
Prevention-
are
characterized
by
small-group
discussions
among students and with their mothers; in both settings
participants engage in dialogue in a nonthreatening climate
while encouraging cultivation of feedback and support between
them (McWhirter and McWhirter, 2010).
Moreover, three studies promoted collaborative interactions
between parents, teachers, and mental health professionals
(Bradshaw et al., 2009; McWhirter and McWhirter, 2010; Atkins
et al., 2015). Interactive features of these mental health programs
include building positive peer groups and partnerships, solving
problems peacefully, and fostering parent-student interactions,
among others. This aligns with the need for an integration of the
school ecology into program planning and the implementation
of eﬀective programs, as observed in the Link to Learning
(L2L) service model instituted in classrooms and homes to
support children with disruptive behavior disorders living in
urban low-income communities (Atkins et al., 2015). In the
same vein, collaboration between parents and teachers in
classrooms is at the heart of the Family-School Partnership
Program (Bradshaw et al., 2009). Discussion-based interactions
include parents reading aloud to their children, with a particular
emphasis in the promotion of reasoning among the students.
Interaction is guided-by open-ended questions after the reading
or using other materials, such as videotapes. Parents reacted
to and discussed the situations and problem-solved alternative
approaches. Discussions were also held on problem situations
arising at home.
Fostering Communicative Skills and Home–School
Interaction
Communication skills and family communication practice are
a central component of READY—a family-based intervention
program to prevent HIV infection and mental health problems
(Puﬀer et al., 2016). The interaction and the communication
skills training involved families, caregivers, children, and the
community, as the intervention was carried out in religious
congregations. By improving family communication as a
protective factor against mental health disorders, READY draws
on a promising approach to strengthen protective family
processes that may prevent future negative outcomes for
adolescents (Puﬀer et al., 2016). In conjunction with these
activities, and while the program was being implemented,
interaction was also fostered, using a voicemail system to
cultivate parents’ involvement and to provide consultation on an
as-needed basis, and asking parents to ﬁll in and return comment
sheets indicating whether they had completed the weekly home
activities and whether they had encountered any problems.
For their part, Atkins et al. (2010) carried out an intervention
that targeted home-school communication and home routines
that support learning, homework support, and daily readings.
They promoted interaction between parents and teachers by

means of two techniques: Daily Report Cards and Good News
Notes. Daily Reports Cards, on the one hand, consist of
cards in which teachers and parents join eﬀorts to identify,
monitor, and reinforce behaviors that interfere with learning.
Teachers and parents agree on a rating system to track
behaviors, a reward schedule, and a plan for monitoring
intervals that will enhance both direct feedback to students
and home-school communication. Good News Notes, on the
other hand, are certiﬁcates that teachers send to families
detailing desirable behaviors exhibited by children, as a means
to provide positive weekly feedback to parents. The Notes
identify students’ strengths, scaﬀold behavior improvement by
reinforcing small achievements, and balance infraction reports
with positive feedback.
Overall, these studies report a multilevel approach, tackling
schools, families, communities, and mental health providers and
services. The three articles include programs that evidence the
crucial role of family and parental engagement in promoting
mental health among adolescents (Connell and Dishion, 2008;
Puﬀer et al., 2016) and children (Atkins et al., 2015). According to
Connell and Dishion (2008), providing family-centered services
in the school environment facilitated family engagement in
the program.
Engaging in Dialogue With Community Members
Engaging in dialogue with the very community members who
might be at risk of suﬀering mental health problems is essential
for the success of the intervention. Some strategies for their
involvement include the creation of a local Community Advisory
Committee (Puﬀer et al., 2016) or a Community Advisory Board
(Kia-Keating et al., 2017). The latter engage participants in
reciprocal dialogues on solutions for issues ranging from violence
exposure and health disparities to the diﬃculties encountered by
youth people seeking to thrive, as exempliﬁed by the HEROES
Project (Kia-Keating et al., 2017).
There have been other community-based organizations
studied in California, aimed at promoting “cultures of health”
by engaging people in building social networks, by fostering
solidarity and collective eﬃcacy, or by promoting a shared
commitment to the collective well-being (Puﬀer et al., 2016).
Overall, these programs promote dialogic spaces in which
the voices of the minorities, who have often been excluded,
are instead given prominence and listened to, in order to
look for solutions that will address the inequalities aﬀecting
their communities.
Effects
The
eﬀects
of
the
interventions
carried
out
in
schools
and communities with an emphasis on fostering supportive
interactions as discussed above have beneﬁted children and
adolescents as reported in the following dimensions:
Internalizing
symptomatology:
Three
studies
include
interventions that have had positive eﬀects on the treatment
and prevention of aﬀective disorders such as depression
and anxiety. Thus, Connell and Dishion (2008) ascertained,
throughout 3 years, their potential to reduce and prevent the
increase of depressive symptoms in at-risk early adolescents.
Likewise, Ohl et al. (2013) conﬁrmed the eﬀectiveness
of
relationships
for
decreasing
emotional
symptoms.
McWhirter and McWhirter (2010) garnered the results
of the GOPEP intervention program (McWhirter et al.,
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org
6
April 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 918
García-Carrión et al.
Interaction-Based Interventions for Mental Health
1997), based on group sessions and on conjoint sessions,
which entailed substantial collaboration between researchers
and participants, and conﬁrmed the eﬀectiveness of the
SOAR program (Student Optimistic Attitudes and Resilience
Program) in reducing anxiety and depression. The FREE
program, for its part, was eﬀective in decreasing self-
isolation among children and their mothers, survivors of
domestic violence.
Externalizing
symptomatology:
Four
articles
present
improvements in aspects related to aggression and behavioral
issues. Ohl et al. (2013) conﬁrmed that the Pyramid project
helped improve peer problems; however, they did not
ﬁnd positive eﬀects on behavioral problems. McWhirter
and McWhirter (2010) gathered evidence conﬁrming the
eﬀectiveness of the FREE project in decreasing family conﬂict,
and of the SCARE (Student-Created Aggression Replacement
Education)
program,
one
of
the
GOPEP
intervention
programs, in decreasing and managing aggression, anger,
and violent behaviors. However, Cappella et al. (2012) did
not ﬁnd signiﬁcative diﬀerences in behavioral regulation as
an eﬀect of their BRIDGE intervention, although children
identiﬁed as having behavioral problems beneﬁtted more
than their peers in the area of social relations. On the other
hand, Bradshaw et al. (2009) conﬁrmed the long-term positive
eﬀects in reducing behavioral and mental-health problems
resulting of the CC intervention.
Personal well-being: Six of the studies reported positive
eﬀects on strengthening psychological-related aspects to
well-being, including self-concept, self-esteem, self-eﬃcacy,
and empowerment, among others. Cappella et al. (2012)
conﬁrmed the existence of a positive eﬀect of intervention on
children’s academic self-concept. Atkins et al. (2015) found
a signiﬁcantly greater improvement on social skills among
children who had been involved in the intervention, whereas
Ohl et al. (2013) ascertained its positive eﬀect on prosocial
behavior. Houlston et al. (2011) conﬁrmed that peer support
improves self-esteem in victims of bullying, as well as their
perception of the support provided by friends and other
students. Participants stated that peer support had a positive
impact on students’ relationships, improving and building
peer networks with trained peer supporters and other students.
More speciﬁcally, in bullying situations, students considered
peer support to be helpful for a number of reasons, including
being able to talk about it, having peers to interact with, or
helping bullied students to tell others of their plight.
Bloemraad and Terriquez (2016) gathered the opinions
of people taking part in activities organized by CBOs
(Community-Based Organizations). Results provide evidence
of the impact that involvement in CBOs has on participants,
namely when preparing to enroll and succeed in college,
as well as on their self-reported civic capacity developing
skills, which encompass skills as diverse as communicating
with others, understanding the impact that government
decisions have on the community, speaking in public, or
planning events. Besides, the involvement in CBOs improves
personal empowerment and self-eﬃcacy, as participants learn
to stand up for their beliefs, become more aware of health
issues impacting their communities, and learn about their
own culture or ethnic group. As for health and education
outcomes, participants became more informed about college
and career options, took better care of their personal health,
and improved their school grades.
McWhirter and McWhirter (2010) showed that the FREE
project resulted in an increase in children’s and women’s
emotional well-being, peer engagement and self-esteem in
children, as well as women’s self-eﬃcacy.
Context: Five of the interventions reported improvements
on the classroom climate and teacher-student and peer
interactions. The study carried out by Cappella et al.
(2012), based on BRIDGE intervention, demonstrates how
classroom interactions generate a positive climate where
emotional support and teacher sensitivity are prominent.
These interactions also promote a positive classroom climate,
characterized by optimal behavior management, productivity,
and instructional learning formats. Furthermore, they have
been veriﬁed to help develop instructional support, more
positive teacher expectations regarding children’s behavior,
and a more responsive teacher-student relationship. The
study by McWhirter and McWhirter (2010), based on
group interventions, highlights that interacting with other
people helps build positive peer/adult relationships. These
conclusions are shared by Puﬀer et al. (2016), whose
study focused on family communication, and who conclude
that intra-family communication improves well-being. In a
similar vein, Bloemraad and Terriquez (2016) ﬁnd that the
interactions fostered by the intervention improve well-being
in the community.
DISCUSSION
The present systematic review of studies has fulﬁlled the objective
of identifying evidence for positive eﬀects of interaction-based
interventions in schools and communities in children’s and
adolescents’ mental health. We have shown that mental health
interventions, in which supportive interactions are fostered
among diﬀerent actors, have a positive eﬀect in decreasing
aﬀective symptoms and in increasing personal wellbeing among
children and adolescents.
We detected in these programs an emphasis on engaging
children and adolescents in supportive interactions with
other relevant adults, such as teachers, family, community
members, and other professionals. Overall it showcases the
beneﬁts
children
and
adolescents
without
mental
health
problems can reap, particularly in preventive interventions
as nine of the studies focused on. Only two studies target
adolescents and children with mental health problems (Connell
and Dishion, 2008; Fazel, 2015). The literature analyzed
sheds light on the importance of preventive interventions
where diﬀerent agents work together toward the common
goal of promoting children’s and adolescents’ mental health
(Atkins et al., 2015; Kia-Keating et al., 2017).
Positive eﬀects on mental health are achieved through
interventions that are culturally appropriate and culturally

Interaction-Based Interventions for Mental Health
grounded (Bloemraad and Terriquez, 2016; Puﬀer et al., 2016;
Kia-Keating et al., 2017). This is particularly important in those
interventions which require the active engagement of families
and community members. The role of family and community
members emerges as particularly relevant and providing
them with communicative skills and fostering home-school
communication are assets for the mental health interventions.
Schools thus become an ideal space to facilitate family and
community involvement, and they consequently present a great
potential for enhancing positive parent-teacher, teacher-student
and student-student interactions. This is consistent with other
research that has focused on the beneﬁts of school-based mental
health interventions to help them develop cognitively, socially,
and emotionally (Fazel et al., 2014).
There is enough supporting evidence on the potential of these
interventions for schools to create a positive climate based on
instructional and emotional support, solidarity and friendship
that improves the well-being of children and communities
(McWhirter and McWhirter, 2010; Bloemraad and Terriquez,
2016; Puﬀer et al., 2016). Available evidence on the eﬀectiveness
of these studies attests to the attainment of positive gains in
students’ academic achievement, which will also lead to other
long-term positive eﬀects that will help prevent behavioral and
mental-health problems (Bradshaw et al., 2009). This positive
eﬀect is particularly strong in high poverty contexts (Atkins
et al., 2015). Particularly relevant is the reduction of anxiety and
depression, especially in light of the marked increase of the latter,
currently ailing 4,4% of the world population (WHO, 2017).
Overall, we argue that interaction-based approaches in mental
health interventions, that involve diverse actors in productive
forms of dialogue and supportive interactions, are consistent
with the beneﬁts reported by the sociocultural approaches to
learning and development (Vygotsky, 1978). However, in this
systematic review we have not been able to determine the
eﬀect of the interaction on the eﬀectiveness of the intervention.
This is consistent with the literature, as eﬀective mental
health interventions, which include collective interactions among
diﬀerent agents as a central element of the intervention, did
not revealed how those interactions were linked to the positive
outcomes obtained (Seikkula and Arnkil, 2006). Similarly, the
primary studies reviewed do not established a direct link of
the interaction component of the intervention with the positive
mental health outcomes. This question still remains.
Limitation and Future Directions
In this systematic review we have reviewed a set of interventions
for
both
adolescents
and
children,
without
explicitly
distinguishing within the two study groups. This raises a
limitation as children and adolescents can potentially show
diﬀerent needs in terms of mental and behavioral support.
Consequently, there could be potential diﬀerences in the
outcomes that have not been considered in this review. In the
same vein, this study only reviewed research in English and most
research was conducted in the United States, which could also
limit the generalizability of the results.
On the other hand, the concept of interaction we explored it
is a broad concept that presents some limitations in providing
a consistent deﬁnition within the interventions. Furthermore,
the primary studies reported the eﬀects of the intervention
as a whole. Therefore, their methodological designs do not
allow to identify the speciﬁc eﬀect on mental health of the
interaction itself. Still there is a gap to determine the eﬀect
of the interactions on the mental health outcomes. Further
research is needed to explore the particular role and potential
of social interaction to promote children and adolescents’
mental health.
CONCLUSIONS
This systematic review of 11 studies has focused on mental
health interventions in which interaction plays an important
role. Supportive interactions carried out in the framework of
mental health interventions involve various contexts, agents and
systems, including teachers, parents, mental-health professionals,
and members of the community.
There is evidence of a positive eﬀect on the mental health
of children and adolescents, both in decreasing internalizing
and externalizing symptoms, and in promoting personal well-
being. Factors that foster mental health as social support or
engagement also increase with interventions programs that
include interaction as a main feature.
However, more research is needed into the speciﬁc impact
of interaction on the mental health of children and adolescents,
as well as analyzing the type of interactions that have the most
beneﬁcial eﬀect.
